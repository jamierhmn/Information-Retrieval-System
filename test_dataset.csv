}] UDGMENT & ORDER (CAV)
Heard Mr. HRA Choudhury, learned sr. This appeal has been preferred by the appellants against the judgment and
order dated 25.11.2013 passed by the learned Assistant Sessions J udge, Karimganj in
Sessions Case No. He also caused bite injury on
her right breast after removing her top cloth. During that time accused Mukul Bardhan
was guarding with a dao on his hand. The moment she arrived at the place of
occurrence both the accused persons run away. After receiving the ejahar the Officer-in-Charge of the Patherkandi Police
Station registered a case being Patherkandi Police Station Case No.138/2008 U/S
448/376/34 IPC. Thereafter the wheel of criminal investigation put into motion and
after completion of the investigation the investigating officer of the Patherkandi Police
Station case no. 138/08 submitted charge-sheet under Section 448/376 IPC against the

accused persons. Both the accused persons stood the trial before the Court of

Assistant Sessions J udge, Karimganj in Sessions Case Noi.37/2010 U/S 448/376 IPC. Thereafter the learned Assistant Sessions Judge, Karimganj framed charge
against both the accused persons U/S 448/376/34 IPC after hearing learned counsel
for both sides. The charges having been read and explained to the accused persons

both of them pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. The prosecution examined as many as 8 (eight) witnesses and exhibited
altogether six documents. Upon closure of
evidence of prosecution side both the accused persons/ appellants were examined U/S

313 CrPC. At the conclusion of trial the accused persons were held guilty and convicted
them U/S 448/376/34 IPC as aforesaid. Being aggrieved with the aforesaid judgment,

the present appeal has been preferred. 9, The learned senior counsel Mr. HRA Choudhury in his argument has urged

before this Court that the prosecution case is under the shadow of doubt due to
variety of reasons such as there was earlier enmity between the parties as the
informant has filed theft (of goat)case as against the petitioner and the evidence of
mother of the victim that she immediately appeared at the place of occurrence is not
at all true as she was taking bath at rivulet which is at a distance from their house. Further it is submitted that the evidence of PW 3
(being the sister of victim) and PW 5 (being the relative) is not at all reliable. Referring
to the evidence of the medical officer it has been canvassed that there being no finding
of sexual intercourse upon the victim it also belies the allegation of rape and the

accused appellants are entitled to get benefit of all lapse in the prosecution story. P.P. the learned Court has properly appreciated all the evidence on record and rightly

held the accused petitioner guilty under the law. Having regard to the submission made above, let us appreciate the evidence on
record. At that
time accused Ajay Verdhan trespassed into their house and dragged her to the jungle
situated towards back side of their house and accused Mukul Bardhan was standing at
the Verandha of their house armed with a dao in his hand. Accused Ajay Bardhan also removed her top (upper portion of the
cloth) caused injury on her right breast by biting and as a result she sustained severe
Injury with bleeding. She was then
taken to home back by her mother and applied certain pan juice on the injured
portion of her right breast. At around 8.00 PM when her father returned home then her
mother disclosed him the entire matter. Police then sent them to Karimganj Civil Hospital for her medical

examination and treatment. The rivulet
where her mother was taking bath was situated at a distance of 150 meters ( approx)
toward east down their till homestead and the place of occurrence is about 5/6 Nal
away from their house. She stated that accused Mukul Bardhan is the brother-in-law of
accused Ajay Bardhan. It is stated that for around 10 minutes the
accused committed the sexual intercourse. She did not know if her father lodged any

theft case against Mukul Bardhan. M other of the victim, Runu Bala Nath/PW 2 has testified that four years back
on the day of occurrence while she was taking bath at rivulet, hearing hue and cry
raised by her younger daughter (PW 4), she arrived at her homestead. She narrated the incident to her husband
on his return home at night and then her husband informed the matter to the
neighbour and then to police and next morning victim was taken to Patharkandi

police Station. PW 1, father of victim /informant deposed that on the day of occurrence when
he returned home from the market at about 9/9.30 pm his wife and his daughter PW 3
narrated the incident of rape by the accused appellant Ajay Barman and duly guarded
by accused Mukul Barman. At the relevant time his 9 years daughter Anit (PW 4) was
present at his house and his wife was bathing at rivulet. Thereafter he informed the
matter to Gunomoi Nath (PW 5), Monoi Natha, Bimal Suklabaidya. During cross
examination this witness stated that police having witnessed the oozing of bleeding
Injury from her right breast and sent her to Karimganj Civil Hospital for medical
examination. He replied that at first his wife narrated the incident and thereafter his
daughter to him. He also replied that
prior to the occurrence both the accused appellants had stolen his goat and killed it for

flesh for which he filed an FIR against them. PW 5 Sri Gunomoni Nath is a neighbour, in his examination in chief he deposed
that about 5 years back, on certain night, Nidhu Nath (PW 1) father of the victim
informed him over telephone stating that accused appellants dragged his daughter
(victim) from his house and did bad works with her. PW 1 requested him to visit his
house but as it was night so expressed his inability to go their house. The victim was examined by the PW 6 Dr. Sibnath Paul as on 8.9.2008 and on
physical examination he found circular type of teeth bite 1 4%” x Y%” on the right
breast above the right axial with tenderness in the vaginal area and hymen was
absent. 3 is medical report, vide Ext.4 is the vaginal swab report, Ext. It transpires that PW 6 has exhibited the report for and on behalf of the
doctor Swapan Kr. Sen as said doctor was transferred, but subsequently said doctor
Swapan Kr. Sen was also examined as PW 8 and hence the evidence of PW 6 and PW
8 are exactly same. Moreover the PW 8 in cross examination has clarified after
verifying the radiological photograph/ X-ray report of the victim, he wrote the report to

the certificate. No any serious contradiction of any witness has been proved through the |O

DEFENCE EVIDNCE

19. In support of plea of denial defence examined three witness those are DW 1
Niranjan Malakar, DW 2 Dhiraj Deb and DW 3 Smti J unu Deb. DW 3 also stated to
have attended in the said Kirtan in the House of Mukul Bardhan in the evening, while

the DW 2 has stated that he did not know anything about the occurrence. It is also admitted that

they cannot say about any incident prior to 6.30 PM and such evidence bears no value. In the present case the incident happened at about 6 PM which is not even fully
dark evening in the month of September (date of occurrence 7.9.2008) as stated by
the witnesses. It is not a case of

consensus sexual affairs between the parties and the proof of age of prosecutrix is
10

irrelevant. Nothing emerges to discredit the evidence of the victim girl as well as other

evidence on record. It is settled that the testimony of a victim in cases of sexual
offence is vital and unless there is compelling reasons which necessitating looking for
corroboration of a statement, the Court should not find difficulty to act on the
testimony of victim alone on sexual assault to convict the accused. The deposition of
the prosecutrix thus to be taken as a whole. Needless to reiterate that the victim of
rape is not an accomplice and her evidence can be acted upon without corroboration. She stands at a higher pedestral than an injured witness thus. In the case of State of Himachal Pradesh Vs Raghubir Singh, reported in (1993)
2 SCC 622, the Hon'ble Apex Court held that there is no legal compulsion to look for
any other evidence to corroborate the evidence of the prosecutrix before recording an
order of conviction. Thus, the law that
emerges on the issue is to the effect that statement of prosecutrix, if found to be
worthy of credence and reliable, requires no corroboration. The Court may convict the

accused on the sole testimony of the prosecutrix. /t 1s also a matter of common law that in Indian society any girl
or woman would not make such allegations against a person as
she Is fully aware of the reoercussions following therefrom. If
she Is found to be false, she would be looked by the society with
contempt throughout her life. For an unmarried girl, it will be
difficult to find a suitable groom. Therefore, unless an offence
has really be committed, a girl or a woman would be extremely
reluctant even to admit that any such inadent had taken jlace
Which Is likely to reflect on her chastity. She would also be
conscious of the danger of being ostracized by the society. /t
would indeed be difficult for her to survive in Indian society
Which Is, of course, not as forward looking as the western

countries are. Thus, in a case of rape, testimony of a prosecutnix stands at par
with that of an injured witness. In such event the PW 4 was the best available witness in the occurrence and
her mother/PW 2 was the next available witness. In such chain of events there

appears no any possibility of fabrication of any story on the part any of these
12

witnesses. The father of the victinyPW 1 was also apprised
immediately after the occurrence by his wife and in turn PW 1 informed the matter
over phone to PW 5 without any delay. The fact that the PW 5 was informed also
appears to be quite normal because such matter of sexual assault generally informed
to relatives rather than to outsiders. Although all the witnesses cross-examined at

length but nothing divulged so as to discredit the evidence of the witnesses. Her evidence does not suffer from any sort of infirmities to raise doubt about
the authenticity of her testimony. It is stated that she has no
knowledge if her father filed a case against Mukul Bardhan. In her detailed cross
examination she has specifically stated that there are sever pain on her right breast for
biting and doctor gave her treatment. The medical evidence also supported about the
finding of injury on her breast and private parts while it is said that there was
tenderness at the vagina and hymen was absent, along with injury on her breast. The type of injury found on the victim
indicative of sexual assault upon her at the time of incident and suggestive of sexual
Intercourse as revealed by the victim girl. The plea of the appellants abut enmity does
not sound well as the same has not been proved. the court is duty bound to deal with such cases with utmost sensitivity. Minor
contradictions or insignificant discrepancies in the statement of a prosecutrix should
not be a ground for throwing out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. The court
may look for some assurances of her statement to satisfy judicial conscience. The
statement of the prosecutrix is more reliable than that of an injured witness as she is

not an accomplice. The rapist degrades the very soul of the helpless female and, therefore, the
testimony of the prosecutrix must be appreciated in the background of the entire case
and in such cases, non-examination even of other witnesses may not be a serious

infirmity in the prosecution case, particularly where the witnesses had not seen the

commission of offence. 2/. In the instant case as is evident from the matters on record both the accused
persons acted in concert by sharing a common intention while committing the offence. The conduct of the co-accused Mukul Bardhan comes
within the purview of section gang rape. Although the learned counsel for the
appellants has submitted that section 376 (2)(g) IPC refers to a different provisions i.e.
“commiting rape during communal and sectarian violence” which is not applicable to
the present case but it can be noted that the said provision is made under the

amended Act with effect from 3.2.2013 but having regard to the fact that the offence
15

committed prior to the amendment, the offence U/S 376 (2)(g) IPC “gang rape” will

come into play and the learned trial Court has dealt accordingly. X XX XX Xx xx A bare reading of Section 375 makes the position
clear that rape can be committed only by a man. The section itself
provides as to when a man can be said to have committed rape. Section 376(2) makes certain categories of serious cases of rape
as enumerated therein attract more severe punishment. The Explanation only indicates that when one or
more persons act in furtherance of their common intention to rape
a woman, each person of the group shall be deemed to have
committed gang rape. Common
intention"" denotes action in concert and necessarily postulates a
pre-arranged plan, a prior meeting of minds and an element of
participation in action. The acts may be different and vary in
character, but must be actuated by the same common intention,
which is different from same intention or similar intention. The
sine qua non for bringing in application of Section 34 IPC that
the act must be done in furtherance of the common intention to
do a criminal act. As per the legal provision as well as the legal pronouncement discussed above
even though the co-accused Mukul Bardhan has not committed rape but by virtue of
such deeming provisions he is also guilty of the offence as he accompanied the other
accused in furtherance of common intention, knowing — fully well what has been
committed by the other accused. Section 34 IPC provides that- when a criminal act Is
done by several persons in furtherance of common intention of all, each of such
person is liable for the act in the same manner as if it was done by him alone. The
Section lays down a principle of joint liability in the doing of a criminal act. In view of the findings and discussion above, the appeal is devoid of merit,

hence dismissed. J UDGE

}] UDGMENT & ORDER (CAV)
Heard Mr. HRA Choudhury, learned sr. counsel appearing for the appellants as

well as Mr. Bidyut Sarma, learned Addl. Public Prosecutor, Assam, for the Respondent
State.
2. This appeal has been preferred by the appellants against the judgment and
order dated 25.11.2013 passed by the learned Assistant Sessions J udge, Karimganj in
Sessions Case No. 37 of 2010 convicting the accused appellants U/Ss 448/376(2)(g)
IPC and sentencing them to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one years under
Section 448 of the India Penal Code, 1860 and further sentencing them to undergo
rigorous imprisonment for 10 (ten) years each under Section 376 (2)(g) IPC and fine
of Rs.5000/- each in default to undergo further rigorous impressments for two years.

Both the sentences will run concurrently.

3. The prosecution case _in brief is that on 7.9.2008 during evening time at about
6.00 pm, accused Ajay Bardhan and Mukul Bardhan in absence of informant Nidhu
Nath and his wife of village Goalpur abruptly trespassed into their house and they
forcibly dragged out the daughter of the informant after gagging her mouth with cloth
and showing dagger to her, while she was refilling kerosene oil in the hurricane lamp.
They dragged her to the jungle situated in the backside of the house of the informant,
and thereafter, accused Ajay Bardhan having removed wearing ‘saloar pant’ of the
victim girl forcibly committed sexual intercourse with her. He also caused bite injury on
her right breast after removing her top cloth. During that time accused Mukul Bardhan
was guarding with a dao on his hand. As soon as PW 2 Runubala Nath being the
mother of the victim girl heard alarm raised by her minor child, she immediately rushed
from the rivulet down their tilla homestead. The moment she arrived at the place of
occurrence both the accused persons run away. At night when the father of the victim
Nidhu Nath/informant (PW 1) returned home, the occurrence was reported to him by
his wife Runubala Nath. Thereafter the informant lodged an ejahar against the accused

at Patherkandi Police Station on 9.9.2008.
4. After receiving the ejahar the Officer-in-Charge of the Patherkandi Police
Station registered a case being Patherkandi Police Station Case No.138/2008 U/S
448/376/34 IPC. Thereafter the wheel of criminal investigation put into motion and
after completion of the investigation the investigating officer of the Patherkandi Police
Station case no. 138/08 submitted charge-sheet under Section 448/376 IPC against the

accused persons.

5. The case was committed by the learned J udicial Magistrate, 1 Class, Karimganj
to the Court of learned Sessions J udge, Karimganj who in turn transferred the records
of the G.R. Case No.783/08 to the Court of learned Assistant Sessions Judge,
Karimganj for trial. Both the accused persons stood the trial before the Court of

Assistant Sessions J udge, Karimganj in Sessions Case Noi.37/2010 U/S 448/376 IPC.

6. Thereafter the learned Assistant Sessions Judge, Karimganj framed charge
against both the accused persons U/S 448/376/34 IPC after hearing learned counsel
for both sides. The charges having been read and explained to the accused persons

both of them pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.

7. The prosecution examined as many as 8 (eight) witnesses and exhibited
altogether six documents. The defence examined 3(three) witnesses. Upon closure of
evidence of prosecution side both the accused persons/ appellants were examined U/S

313 CrPC.

8. At the conclusion of trial the accused persons were held guilty and convicted
them U/S 448/376/34 IPC as aforesaid. Being aggrieved with the aforesaid judgment,

the present appeal has been preferred.

9, The learned senior counsel Mr. HRA Choudhury in his argument has urged

before this Court that the prosecution case is under the shadow of doubt due to
variety of reasons such as there was earlier enmity between the parties as the
informant has filed theft (of goat)case as against the petitioner and the evidence of
mother of the victim that she immediately appeared at the place of occurrence is not
at all true as she was taking bath at rivulet which is at a distance from their house.
Further it contends that the allegation about the involvement of both the accused
petitioners is highly improbable as accused Mukul Bardhan is brother in law of the
accused Ajay Bardhan and no person will indulge in such matter of sexual assault
along with his own brother in law. Further it is submitted that the evidence of PW 3
(being the sister of victim) and PW 5 (being the relative) is not at all reliable. Referring
to the evidence of the medical officer it has been canvassed that there being no finding
of sexual intercourse upon the victim it also belies the allegation of rape and the

accused appellants are entitled to get benefit of all lapse in the prosecution story.

10. Per contra, the learned Addl. P.P.Mr. B.Sarma has vehemently submitted that
the evidence of each and every witness is more than convincing so as to prove the
guilt of the accused to the heel and the authenticity of the witnesses remained
unshaken throughout the cross examination at length. Examination of immediate
available witness, which may be the relative to the victim is the necessity of
prosecution case, instead of counting the number of witnesses that could have been
examined by the prosecution who might have arrived much after the incident.
Furthermore it has also been contended that the evidence of MO in totality is sufficient
to infer the sexual assault upon the victim girl, even though no specific opinion has
been rendered by the M O about sexual intercourse. The fact that the victim girl is, a
minor one is another vital aspect deserves consideration, as to the necessity for false
Implication of a person by the victim by relieving the actual assailant, while she has

suffered sufficient physical injury in the incident. Thus according to the learned Addl.
P.P. the learned Court has properly appreciated all the evidence on record and rightly

held the accused petitioner guilty under the law.

11. Having regard to the submission made above, let us appreciate the evidence on
record. Parents of the victim have deposed their evidence as PW 1, PW 2 and PW 3is
the victim, PW 4 is the younger sister of the victim and PW 5 is the independent

witness and others are medical officer and investigating officer.

12. Let us first appreciate the evidence of PW 3 (victim) who has _ deposed in her
evidence that on the day of occurrence when she was filling kerosene oil in the lamp
In the evening hours at their house and at that time her father was at market and her
mother also went to take bath at the back side of their house at chara (rivulet). At that
time accused Ajay Verdhan trespassed into their house and dragged her to the jungle
situated towards back side of their house and accused Mukul Bardhan was standing at
the Verandha of their house armed with a dao in his hand. She further stated that in
the jungle accused Mukul Bardhan was guarding her and accused Ajay Bardhan did
Intercourse with her inserting his penis into her vagina after removing her wearing
cloth (chaloar pant). Accused Ajay Bardhan also removed her top (upper portion of the
cloth) caused injury on her right breast by biting and as a result she sustained severe
Injury with bleeding. While Ajay Bardhan dragged her towards’ the jungle, her
younger sister raised alarm and her mother arrived with a lathi and noticing arrival of
her mother at the place of occurrence, both the accused fled away. She was then
taken to home back by her mother and applied certain pan juice on the injured
portion of her right breast. At around 8.00 PM when her father returned home then her
mother disclosed him the entire matter. Her father then informed the matter to his

neighbours and she was taken to Patherkandi Police Station on the next morning by
her father. Police then sent them to Karimganj Civil Hospital for her medical

examination and treatment.

In cross examination, she stated that accused appellant Ajay Bardhan and
Mukul Bardhan took her away by holding her hands and legs at the relevant time to
the place of occurrence then her brother and sister were raising alarm. The rivulet
where her mother was taking bath was situated at a distance of 150 meters ( approx)
toward east down their till homestead and the place of occurrence is about 5/6 Nal
away from their house. She stated that accused Mukul Bardhan is the brother-in-law of
accused Ajay Bardhan. She further explained that as soon as the accused persons
were lifting her from the house, her brother and sister instantly ran to her mother (PW
2) at rivulet and inform the matter. It is stated that for around 10 minutes the
accused committed the sexual intercourse. She did not know if her father lodged any

theft case against Mukul Bardhan.

13. M other of the victim, Runu Bala Nath/PW 2 has testified that four years back
on the day of occurrence while she was taking bath at rivulet, hearing hue and cry
raised by her younger daughter (PW 4), she arrived at her homestead. PW 4 reported
her about dragging of the victim ( P W 3) by the accused appellants towards back side
of their homestead, then she immediately rushed to the backside jungle and
witnessed that accused Mukul Bardhan was standing with dao on his hand and accused
Ajay Bardhan was lying on the body of the victim and she _ noticed that
pant/blouse/skirt of her daughter were removed. Seeing her both the accused ran
away and she brought back PW 3 to home. She narrated the incident to her husband
on his return home at night and then her husband informed the matter to the
neighbour and then to police and next morning victim was taken to Patharkandi

police Station. In her cross examination she has reaffirmed what she deposed in her
examination-in-chief and narrated more details of the occurrence, that she found the

pantry of her daughter lying on the ground, top of the girl also blood strained.

14. PW 1, father of victim /informant deposed that on the day of occurrence when
he returned home from the market at about 9/9.30 pm his wife and his daughter PW 3
narrated the incident of rape by the accused appellant Ajay Barman and duly guarded
by accused Mukul Barman. At the relevant time his 9 years daughter Anit (PW 4) was
present at his house and his wife was bathing at rivulet. Thereafter he informed the
matter to Gunomoi Nath (PW 5), Monoi Natha, Bimal Suklabaidya. On the next day he
lodged Ejahar before the Patharkandi Police Station and the police forwarded his
daughter (PW 3) to Karimganj Civil Hospital for medical examination. During cross
examination this witness stated that police having witnessed the oozing of bleeding
Injury from her right breast and sent her to Karimganj Civil Hospital for medical
examination. He replied that at first his wife narrated the incident and thereafter his
daughter to him. He also narrated that place of occurrence is a jungle covered by
grass, trees and bushes and is situated 7/8 nals from his house. He also replied that
prior to the occurrence both the accused appellants had stolen his goat and killed it for

flesh for which he filed an FIR against them.

15. PW 4, Smti Ami Nat (aged 13 years) deposed on 10.4.2013 that she knew
accused appellants who were their neighbours. The occurrence took place about 4/5
years back and on a certain day of evening when she was at home and her elder sister
Suparna Nath was also present, however her parents were not at home then accused
appellants Ajay Bardhan and Mukul Bardhan went to their house and forcibly dragged
her elder sister when she was pouring kerosene oil at a hurricane. She immediately

raised alarm and ran to her mother who was taking bath at rivulet informed the matter
and then her mother immediately arrived home and went to the place of occurrence

and brought back the victim.

16. PW 5 Sri Gunomoni Nath is a neighbour, in his examination in chief he deposed
that about 5 years back, on certain night, Nidhu Nath (PW 1) father of the victim
informed him over telephone stating that accused appellants dragged his daughter
(victim) from his house and did bad works with her. PW 1 requested him to visit his
house but as it was night so expressed his inability to go their house. Then the PW 1
along with one Monuj Nath (since expired) came to his house and informed the matter
In details and requested him to hold a village bichar and he advised them to approach
the elderly villagers. He replied in cross examination that his house is about % Km

away from the house of the informant and he Is a distant relative of the informant.

17. The victim was examined by the PW 6 Dr. Sibnath Paul as on 8.9.2008 and on
physical examination he found circular type of teeth bite 1 4%” x Y%” on the right
breast above the right axial with tenderness in the vaginal area and hymen was
absent. However, no spermatozoa were found in vaginal swab. Her age is below 18
years, Vide Ext. 3 is medical report, vide Ext.4 is the vaginal swab report, Ext. 5 is Xray Plat. It transpires that PW 6 has exhibited the report for and on behalf of the
doctor Swapan Kr. Sen as said doctor was transferred, but subsequently said doctor
Swapan Kr. Sen was also examined as PW 8 and hence the evidence of PW 6 and PW
8 are exactly same. Moreover the PW 8 in cross examination has clarified after
verifying the radiological photograph/ X-ray report of the victim, he wrote the report to

the certificate.

18. Lastly, PW 7 Abdur Rahman Laskar has testified all about the investigation that

has been conducted by the earlier |.0.(since expired) and has stated that about
collection of the medical report and recording of witnesses as well as filing of charge
sheet. No any serious contradiction of any witness has been proved through the |O

DEFENCE EVIDNCE

19. In support of plea of denial defence examined three witness those are DW 1
Niranjan Malakar, DW 2 Dhiraj Deb and DW 3 Smti J unu Deb. It is to be noted that in
their casual statement DW 1 simply stated that he went to the house of Mukul Bardhan
In the evening at 7.30 PM to attend “Baishnab Sewa” on the occasion of shradha
ceremony of the mother of Mukul Bardhan and there was Kirtan from 7.30 PM to 10.30
PM in his house but in the answer to the Court he has replied that he did not know
what happened prior to 6.30 PM in the house Nidhu (informant). DW 3 also stated to
have attended in the said Kirtan in the House of Mukul Bardhan in the evening, while

the DW 2 has stated that he did not know anything about the occurrence.

20. Obviously such type of vague evidence is of no help to the defence as the
witnesses were not at all specific that for the reason of such shradha ceremony in the
house of Mukul Bardhan it was not possible on the part of Mukul Bardhan as well as
Ajay Bardhan (his brother in law) to involve in the incident. It is also admitted that

they cannot say about any incident prior to 6.30 PM and such evidence bears no value.

21. In the present case the incident happened at about 6 PM which is not even fully
dark evening in the month of September (date of occurrence 7.9.2008) as stated by
the witnesses. Looking into statement of the victim /PW 3 it can be safely held that she
has been ravished sexually by force against her wishes and her testimony got support
of the medical report. That being so, the argument of the appellants’ side, regarding
false implication of the accused appellants is not found maintainable. It is not a case of

consensus sexual affairs between the parties and the proof of age of prosecutrix is
10

irrelevant. Nothing emerges to discredit the evidence of the victim girl as well as other

evidence on record.

22. The law is more or less settled on the proposition that relying on the sole
testimony of prosecutrix in an offence of rape U/S 376 IPC conviction can be sustained
if it inspire confidence. It is settled that the testimony of a victim in cases of sexual
offence is vital and unless there is compelling reasons which necessitating looking for
corroboration of a statement, the Court should not find difficulty to act on the
testimony of victim alone on sexual assault to convict the accused. The deposition of
the prosecutrix thus to be taken as a whole. Needless to reiterate that the victim of
rape is not an accomplice and her evidence can be acted upon without corroboration.

She stands at a higher pedestral than an injured witness thus.

In the case of State of Himachal Pradesh Vs Raghubir Singh, reported in (1993)
2 SCC 622, the Hon'ble Apex Court held that there is no legal compulsion to look for
any other evidence to corroborate the evidence of the prosecutrix before recording an
order of conviction. Evidence has to be weighed and not counted. Conviction can be
recorded on the sole testimony of the prosecutrix, if her evidence inspire confidence
and there is absence of circumstances which mitigate her veracity. Thus, the law that
emerges on the issue is to the effect that statement of prosecutrix, if found to be
worthy of credence and reliable, requires no corroboration. The Court may convict the

accused on the sole testimony of the prosecutrix.

Further the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Wahid Khan Vs- State of
Madhya Pradesh reported in AIR 2010 SC 1, observed in paragraphs 21 and 22 as

follows:
11

“21.  /t 1s also a matter of common law that in Indian society any girl
or woman would not make such allegations against a person as
she Is fully aware of the reoercussions following therefrom. If
she Is found to be false, she would be looked by the society with
contempt throughout her life. For an unmarried girl, it will be
difficult to find a suitable groom. Therefore, unless an offence
has really be committed, a girl or a woman would be extremely
reluctant even to admit that any such inadent had taken jlace
Which Is likely to reflect on her chastity. She would also be
conscious of the danger of being ostracized by the society. /t
would indeed be difficult for her to survive in Indian society
Which Is, of course, not as forward looking as the western

countries are.

22. Thus, in a case of rape, testimony of a prosecutnix stands at par
with that of an injured witness. /t ls really not necessary to insist
for corroboration if the evidence of the prosecunx inspires

contidence and appears to be creaible.”

23. From the sequence of the evidence discussed above it reflect that as at the
time of occurrence the victim was alone in her house and at that time her younger
sister (PW 4) (aged 9 years) at that time was in the house and their mother was
taking bath at the back side of the house and father was absent who was in the
market. In such event the PW 4 was the best available witness in the occurrence and
her mother/PW 2 was the next available witness. PW 4 has clearly described the
incident that it was the two appellants who drag away her elder sister/ PW 3 from
inside the house towards the jungle then she made hue and cry and informed her
mother who was bathing at the rivulet backside the house. Sensing the foul play, PW 2
Immediately went to the back side of the house and found the accused appellants at
the place of occurrence as has been stated above. In such chain of events there

appears no any possibility of fabrication of any story on the part any of these
12

witnesses. PW 4 who is of very tender age of 9 years had no occasion for false
Implication of the accused appellants. The father of the victinyPW 1 was also apprised
immediately after the occurrence by his wife and in turn PW 1 informed the matter
over phone to PW 5 without any delay. The fact that the PW 5 was informed also
appears to be quite normal because such matter of sexual assault generally informed
to relatives rather than to outsiders. Although all the witnesses cross-examined at

length but nothing divulged so as to discredit the evidence of the witnesses.

24. The victim girl on the other hand is found to be minor one (below 18 years) at
the relevant point of time and she has sufficient maturity and explained all about the
matter. Her evidence does not suffer from any sort of infirmities to raise doubt about
the authenticity of her testimony. Nothing suggest about the consent of the victim
towards the affairs nor the credibility of her evidence is at stake, however she has
implicated the accused Ajay Bardhan as regards the rape, while initially both the
accused appellants dragged her outside the house towards the jungle. Accused
appellant Mukul Bardhan is stated to be of her father’s age. It is stated that she has no
knowledge if her father filed a case against Mukul Bardhan. In her detailed cross
examination she has specifically stated that there are sever pain on her right breast for
biting and doctor gave her treatment. The medical evidence also supported about the
finding of injury on her breast and private parts while it is said that there was
tenderness at the vagina and hymen was absent, along with injury on her breast. That
apart, she was minor at the relevant time. The type of injury found on the victim
indicative of sexual assault upon her at the time of incident and suggestive of sexual
Intercourse as revealed by the victim girl. The plea of the appellants abut enmity does
not sound well as the same has not been proved. Mere filing of a theft case cannot be

termed as an enmity between the parties and no father will file a false case at the risk
13

of his minor daughter as in the context of Indian Society, rape upon a woman is

always regarded as stigma.

25. In State of Punjab Vs. Gurmit Singh & Ors reported in AIR 1996 SC 1393,the
Hon’ble Supreme Court held that in cases involving sexual harassment, molestation
etc. the court is duty bound to deal with such cases with utmost sensitivity. Minor
contradictions or insignificant discrepancies in the statement of a prosecutrix should
not be a ground for throwing out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. Evidence of
the victim of sexual assault is enough for conviction and it does not require any
corroboration unless there are compelling reasons for seeking corroboration. The court
may look for some assurances of her statement to satisfy judicial conscience. The
statement of the prosecutrix is more reliable than that of an injured witness as she is

not an accomplice.

“In cases involving sexual molestation, Supposed considerations which
have no material effect on the veracity of the prosecution case or even
discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix should not, unless the
discrepancies are such which are of fatal nature, be allowed to throw
out an otherwise reliable prosecution case Seeking corroboration of her
statement before replying upon the same as a rule, in such cases,
amounts to adding insult to injury Corroboration as a condition for
judicial reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix is not a requirement

of law but a guidance of prudence under given circumstances.

XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXKXXKXKX = =  -XXXKKXKXXKXKX

The courts should examine the broader probabilities of a case
and not get swayed by minor contradictions or _ insignificant
discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix, which are not of a
fatal nature, to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. If
evidence of the prosecutrix inspires confidence, it must be relied upon

without seeking corroboration of her statement in material particulars. If
14

for some reason the court finds it difficult to place implicit reliance on
her testimony, it may look for evidence which may lend assurance to
her testimony, short of corroboration required in the case of an
accomplice. The testimony of the prosecutrix must be appreciated in the
background of the entire case and the trial court must be alive to its
responsibility and be sensitive while dealing with cases involving sexual
molestations. ""
26. In State of Orissa Vs. Thakara Besra & Anr. AIR 2002 SC 1963, it is held that
rape is not mere a physical assault, rather it often distracts the whole personality of
the victim. The rapist degrades the very soul of the helpless female and, therefore, the
testimony of the prosecutrix must be appreciated in the background of the entire case
and in such cases, non-examination even of other witnesses may not be a serious

infirmity in the prosecution case, particularly where the witnesses had not seen the

commission of offence.

2/. In the instant case as is evident from the matters on record both the accused
persons acted in concert by sharing a common intention while committing the offence.
The forceful entry in the house of the informant by both the accused appellants and
dragging the victim towards the back side of the house and another accused Mukul
Bardhan guarding the area with a dao in his hand while the other accused was
committing rape upon the victim, all these facets indicates that by a pre-arranged plan
the offence was committed. The conduct of the co-accused Mukul Bardhan comes
within the purview of section gang rape. Although the learned counsel for the
appellants has submitted that section 376 (2)(g) IPC refers to a different provisions i.e.
“commiting rape during communal and sectarian violence” which is not applicable to
the present case but it can be noted that the said provision is made under the

amended Act with effect from 3.2.2013 but having regard to the fact that the offence
15

committed prior to the amendment, the offence U/S 376 (2)(g) IPC “gang rape” will

come into play and the learned trial Court has dealt accordingly.

28. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Priya Patel vs State of M.P. and another
reported in AIR 2006 (SC) 2639 while dealing with the provision of Section 376 (2) (g)

IPC held as below:

“376. Punishment for rape (1) Whoever, except in the cases
provided for by sub-section (1), commits rape shall be punished
with imprisonment of either description for a term which shall
not be less than seven years but which may be for life or for a
term which may extend to ten years and shall also be liable to
fine unless the women raped is his own wife and is not under
twelve years of age, in which cases, he shall be punished with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend
to two years or with fine or with both:

Provided that the court may, for adequate and special reasons to
be mentioned in the judgment, impose a_ sentence of
imprisonment for a term of less than seven years.

(2) Whoever,-XX XX XX XX XX

(g) commits gang rape, shall be punished with rigorous
imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than ten years
but which may be for life and shall also be liable to fine:

Provided that the court may, for adequate and special reasons to
be mentioned in the judgment, impose a_ sentence of
imprisonment of either description for a term of less than ten
years, Explanation I.—

Where a woman is raped by one or more in a group of
persons acting in furtherance of their common intention, each of
the persons shall be deemed to have committed gang rape within
the meaning of this sub-section.

X XX XX Xx xx A bare reading of Section 375 makes the position
clear that rape can be committed only by a man. The section itself
provides as to when a man can be said to have committed rape.
Section 376(2) makes certain categories of serious cases of rape
as enumerated therein attract more severe punishment. One of
16

them relates to ""gang rape"". The language of sub-section (2)(g)
provides that ""whoever commits 'gang rape"" shall be punished
etc. The Explanation only clarifies that when a woman is raped
by one or more in a group of persons acting in furtherance of
their common intention each such person shall be deemed to have
committed gang rape within this sub-section (2). That cannot
make a woman guilty of committing rape. This is conceptually
inconceivable. The Explanation only indicates that when one or
more persons act in furtherance of their common intention to rape
a woman, each person of the group shall be deemed to have
committed gang rape. By operation of the deeming provision, a
person who has not actually committed rape is deemed to have
committed rape even if only one of the group in furtherance of
the common intention has committed rape. ""Common intention""
is dealt with in Section 34 IPC and provides that when a criminal
act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common
intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the
Same manner as if it was done by him alone. ""Common
intention"" denotes action in concert and necessarily postulates a
pre-arranged plan, a prior meeting of minds and an element of
participation in action. The acts may be different and vary in
character, but must be actuated by the same common intention,
which is different from same intention or similar intention. The
sine qua non for bringing in application of Section 34 IPC that
the act must be done in furtherance of the common intention to
do a criminal act. The expression ""in furtherance of their
common intention"" as appearing in the Explanation to Section
376(2) relates to intention to commit rape.”

29. As per the legal provision as well as the legal pronouncement discussed above
even though the co-accused Mukul Bardhan has not committed rape but by virtue of
such deeming provisions he is also guilty of the offence as he accompanied the other
accused in furtherance of common intention, knowing — fully well what has been
committed by the other accused. Section 34 IPC provides that- when a criminal act Is
done by several persons in furtherance of common intention of all, each of such
person is liable for the act in the same manner as if it was done by him alone. The
Section lays down a principle of joint liability in the doing of a criminal act. The
essence of that liability is to be found in the existence of common intention animating
the accused leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of such common

intention. Once it is found that a criminal act was done in furtherance of the common
17

intention of all, each of such person shall be liable for the criminal act as if it was done
by him alone. The learned trial Court has duly appreciated all matters on record in

proper perspective and calls for no interference.

In view of the findings and discussion above, the appeal is devoid of merit,

hence dismissed. Return the LCR.

}] UDGMENT & ORDER (CAV)
Heard Mr. HRA Choudhury, learned sr. counsel appearing for the appellants as

well as Mr. Bidyut Sarma, learned Addl. Public Prosecutor, Assam, for the Respondent
State.
2. This appeal has been preferred by the appellants against the judgment and
order dated 25.11.2013 passed by the learned Assistant Sessions J udge, Karimganj in
Sessions Case No. 37 of 2010 convicting the accused appellants U/Ss 448/376(2)(g)
IPC and sentencing them to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one years under
Section 448 of the India Penal Code, 1860 and further sentencing them to undergo
rigorous imprisonment for 10 (ten) years each under Section 376 (2)(g) IPC and fine
of Rs.5000/- each in default to undergo further rigorous impressments for two years.

Both the sentences will run concurrently.

3. The prosecution case _in brief is that on 7.9.2008 during evening time at about
6.00 pm, accused Ajay Bardhan and Mukul Bardhan in absence of informant Nidhu
Nath and his wife of village Goalpur abruptly trespassed into their house and they
forcibly dragged out the daughter of the informant after gagging her mouth with cloth
and showing dagger to her, while she was refilling kerosene oil in the hurricane lamp.
They dragged her to the jungle situated in the backside of the house of the informant,
and thereafter, accused Ajay Bardhan having removed wearing ‘saloar pant’ of the
victim girl forcibly committed sexual intercourse with her. He also caused bite injury on
her right breast after removing her top cloth. During that time accused Mukul Bardhan
was guarding with a dao on his hand. As soon as PW 2 Runubala Nath being the
mother of the victim girl heard alarm raised by her minor child, she immediately rushed
from the rivulet down their tilla homestead. The moment she arrived at the place of
occurrence both the accused persons run away. At night when the father of the victim
Nidhu Nath/informant (PW 1) returned home, the occurrence was reported to him by
his wife Runubala Nath. Thereafter the informant lodged an ejahar against the accused

at Patherkandi Police Station on 9.9.2008.
4. After receiving the ejahar the Officer-in-Charge of the Patherkandi Police
Station registered a case being Patherkandi Police Station Case No.138/2008 U/S
448/376/34 IPC. Thereafter the wheel of criminal investigation put into motion and
after completion of the investigation the investigating officer of the Patherkandi Police
Station case no. 138/08 submitted charge-sheet under Section 448/376 IPC against the

accused persons.

5. The case was committed by the learned J udicial Magistrate, 1 Class, Karimganj
to the Court of learned Sessions J udge, Karimganj who in turn transferred the records
of the G.R. Case No.783/08 to the Court of learned Assistant Sessions Judge,
Karimganj for trial. Both the accused persons stood the trial before the Court of

Assistant Sessions J udge, Karimganj in Sessions Case Noi.37/2010 U/S 448/376 IPC.

6. Thereafter the learned Assistant Sessions Judge, Karimganj framed charge
against both the accused persons U/S 448/376/34 IPC after hearing learned counsel
for both sides. The charges having been read and explained to the accused persons

both of them pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.

7. The prosecution examined as many as 8 (eight) witnesses and exhibited
altogether six documents. The defence examined 3(three) witnesses. Upon closure of
evidence of prosecution side both the accused persons/ appellants were examined U/S

313 CrPC.

8. At the conclusion of trial the accused persons were held guilty and convicted
them U/S 448/376/34 IPC as aforesaid. Being aggrieved with the aforesaid judgment,

the present appeal has been preferred.

9, The learned senior counsel Mr. HRA Choudhury in his argument has urged

before this Court that the prosecution case is under the shadow of doubt due to
variety of reasons such as there was earlier enmity between the parties as the
informant has filed theft (of goat)case as against the petitioner and the evidence of
mother of the victim that she immediately appeared at the place of occurrence is not
at all true as she was taking bath at rivulet which is at a distance from their house.
Further it contends that the allegation about the involvement of both the accused
petitioners is highly improbable as accused Mukul Bardhan is brother in law of the
accused Ajay Bardhan and no person will indulge in such matter of sexual assault
along with his own brother in law. Further it is submitted that the evidence of PW 3
(being the sister of victim) and PW 5 (being the relative) is not at all reliable. Referring
to the evidence of the medical officer it has been canvassed that there being no finding
of sexual intercourse upon the victim it also belies the allegation of rape and the

accused appellants are entitled to get benefit of all lapse in the prosecution story.

10. Per contra, the learned Addl. P.P.Mr. B.Sarma has vehemently submitted that
the evidence of each and every witness is more than convincing so as to prove the
guilt of the accused to the heel and the authenticity of the witnesses remained
unshaken throughout the cross examination at length. Examination of immediate
available witness, which may be the relative to the victim is the necessity of
prosecution case, instead of counting the number of witnesses that could have been
examined by the prosecution who might have arrived much after the incident.
Furthermore it has also been contended that the evidence of MO in totality is sufficient
to infer the sexual assault upon the victim girl, even though no specific opinion has
been rendered by the M O about sexual intercourse. The fact that the victim girl is, a
minor one is another vital aspect deserves consideration, as to the necessity for false
Implication of a person by the victim by relieving the actual assailant, while she has

suffered sufficient physical injury in the incident. Thus according to the learned Addl.
P.P. the learned Court has properly appreciated all the evidence on record and rightly

held the accused petitioner guilty under the law.

11. Having regard to the submission made above, let us appreciate the evidence on
record. Parents of the victim have deposed their evidence as PW 1, PW 2 and PW 3is
the victim, PW 4 is the younger sister of the victim and PW 5 is the independent

witness and others are medical officer and investigating officer.

12. Let us first appreciate the evidence of PW 3 (victim) who has _ deposed in her
evidence that on the day of occurrence when she was filling kerosene oil in the lamp
In the evening hours at their house and at that time her father was at market and her
mother also went to take bath at the back side of their house at chara (rivulet). At that
time accused Ajay Verdhan trespassed into their house and dragged her to the jungle
situated towards back side of their house and accused Mukul Bardhan was standing at
the Verandha of their house armed with a dao in his hand. She further stated that in
the jungle accused Mukul Bardhan was guarding her and accused Ajay Bardhan did
Intercourse with her inserting his penis into her vagina after removing her wearing
cloth (chaloar pant). Accused Ajay Bardhan also removed her top (upper portion of the
cloth) caused injury on her right breast by biting and as a result she sustained severe
Injury with bleeding. While Ajay Bardhan dragged her towards’ the jungle, her
younger sister raised alarm and her mother arrived with a lathi and noticing arrival of
her mother at the place of occurrence, both the accused fled away. She was then
taken to home back by her mother and applied certain pan juice on the injured
portion of her right breast. At around 8.00 PM when her father returned home then her
mother disclosed him the entire matter. Her father then informed the matter to his

neighbours and she was taken to Patherkandi Police Station on the next morning by
her father. Police then sent them to Karimganj Civil Hospital for her medical

examination and treatment.

In cross examination, she stated that accused appellant Ajay Bardhan and
Mukul Bardhan took her away by holding her hands and legs at the relevant time to
the place of occurrence then her brother and sister were raising alarm. The rivulet
where her mother was taking bath was situated at a distance of 150 meters ( approx)
toward east down their till homestead and the place of occurrence is about 5/6 Nal
away from their house. She stated that accused Mukul Bardhan is the brother-in-law of
accused Ajay Bardhan. She further explained that as soon as the accused persons
were lifting her from the house, her brother and sister instantly ran to her mother (PW
2) at rivulet and inform the matter. It is stated that for around 10 minutes the
accused committed the sexual intercourse. She did not know if her father lodged any

theft case against Mukul Bardhan.

13. M other of the victim, Runu Bala Nath/PW 2 has testified that four years back
on the day of occurrence while she was taking bath at rivulet, hearing hue and cry
raised by her younger daughter (PW 4), she arrived at her homestead. PW 4 reported
her about dragging of the victim ( P W 3) by the accused appellants towards back side
of their homestead, then she immediately rushed to the backside jungle and
witnessed that accused Mukul Bardhan was standing with dao on his hand and accused
Ajay Bardhan was lying on the body of the victim and she _ noticed that
pant/blouse/skirt of her daughter were removed. Seeing her both the accused ran
away and she brought back PW 3 to home. She narrated the incident to her husband
on his return home at night and then her husband informed the matter to the
neighbour and then to police and next morning victim was taken to Patharkandi

police Station. In her cross examination she has reaffirmed what she deposed in her
examination-in-chief and narrated more details of the occurrence, that she found the

pantry of her daughter lying on the ground, top of the girl also blood strained.

14. PW 1, father of victim /informant deposed that on the day of occurrence when
he returned home from the market at about 9/9.30 pm his wife and his daughter PW 3
narrated the incident of rape by the accused appellant Ajay Barman and duly guarded
by accused Mukul Barman. At the relevant time his 9 years daughter Anit (PW 4) was
present at his house and his wife was bathing at rivulet. Thereafter he informed the
matter to Gunomoi Nath (PW 5), Monoi Natha, Bimal Suklabaidya. On the next day he
lodged Ejahar before the Patharkandi Police Station and the police forwarded his
daughter (PW 3) to Karimganj Civil Hospital for medical examination. During cross
examination this witness stated that police having witnessed the oozing of bleeding
Injury from her right breast and sent her to Karimganj Civil Hospital for medical
examination. He replied that at first his wife narrated the incident and thereafter his
daughter to him. He also narrated that place of occurrence is a jungle covered by
grass, trees and bushes and is situated 7/8 nals from his house. He also replied that
prior to the occurrence both the accused appellants had stolen his goat and killed it for

flesh for which he filed an FIR against them.

15. PW 4, Smti Ami Nat (aged 13 years) deposed on 10.4.2013 that she knew
accused appellants who were their neighbours. The occurrence took place about 4/5
years back and on a certain day of evening when she was at home and her elder sister
Suparna Nath was also present, however her parents were not at home then accused
appellants Ajay Bardhan and Mukul Bardhan went to their house and forcibly dragged
her elder sister when she was pouring kerosene oil at a hurricane. She immediately

raised alarm and ran to her mother who was taking bath at rivulet informed the matter
and then her mother immediately arrived home and went to the place of occurrence

and brought back the victim.

16. PW 5 Sri Gunomoni Nath is a neighbour, in his examination in chief he deposed
that about 5 years back, on certain night, Nidhu Nath (PW 1) father of the victim
informed him over telephone stating that accused appellants dragged his daughter
(victim) from his house and did bad works with her. PW 1 requested him to visit his
house but as it was night so expressed his inability to go their house. Then the PW 1
along with one Monuj Nath (since expired) came to his house and informed the matter
In details and requested him to hold a village bichar and he advised them to approach
the elderly villagers. He replied in cross examination that his house is about % Km

away from the house of the informant and he Is a distant relative of the informant.

17. The victim was examined by the PW 6 Dr. Sibnath Paul as on 8.9.2008 and on
physical examination he found circular type of teeth bite 1 4%” x Y%” on the right
breast above the right axial with tenderness in the vaginal area and hymen was
absent. However, no spermatozoa were found in vaginal swab. Her age is below 18
years, Vide Ext. 3 is medical report, vide Ext.4 is the vaginal swab report, Ext. 5 is Xray Plat. It transpires that PW 6 has exhibited the report for and on behalf of the
doctor Swapan Kr. Sen as said doctor was transferred, but subsequently said doctor
Swapan Kr. Sen was also examined as PW 8 and hence the evidence of PW 6 and PW
8 are exactly same. Moreover the PW 8 in cross examination has clarified after
verifying the radiological photograph/ X-ray report of the victim, he wrote the report to

the certificate.

18. Lastly, PW 7 Abdur Rahman Laskar has testified all about the investigation that

has been conducted by the earlier |.0.(since expired) and has stated that about
collection of the medical report and recording of witnesses as well as filing of charge
sheet. No any serious contradiction of any witness has been proved through the |O

DEFENCE EVIDNCE

19. In support of plea of denial defence examined three witness those are DW 1
Niranjan Malakar, DW 2 Dhiraj Deb and DW 3 Smti J unu Deb. It is to be noted that in
their casual statement DW 1 simply stated that he went to the house of Mukul Bardhan
In the evening at 7.30 PM to attend “Baishnab Sewa” on the occasion of shradha
ceremony of the mother of Mukul Bardhan and there was Kirtan from 7.30 PM to 10.30
PM in his house but in the answer to the Court he has replied that he did not know
what happened prior to 6.30 PM in the house Nidhu (informant). DW 3 also stated to
have attended in the said Kirtan in the House of Mukul Bardhan in the evening, while

the DW 2 has stated that he did not know anything about the occurrence.

20. Obviously such type of vague evidence is of no help to the defence as the
witnesses were not at all specific that for the reason of such shradha ceremony in the
house of Mukul Bardhan it was not possible on the part of Mukul Bardhan as well as
Ajay Bardhan (his brother in law) to involve in the incident. It is also admitted that

they cannot say about any incident prior to 6.30 PM and such evidence bears no value.

21. In the present case the incident happened at about 6 PM which is not even fully
dark evening in the month of September (date of occurrence 7.9.2008) as stated by
the witnesses. Looking into statement of the victim /PW 3 it can be safely held that she
has been ravished sexually by force against her wishes and her testimony got support
of the medical report. That being so, the argument of the appellants’ side, regarding
false implication of the accused appellants is not found maintainable. It is not a case of

consensus sexual affairs between the parties and the proof of age of prosecutrix is
10

irrelevant. Nothing emerges to discredit the evidence of the victim girl as well as other

evidence on record.

22. The law is more or less settled on the proposition that relying on the sole
testimony of prosecutrix in an offence of rape U/S 376 IPC conviction can be sustained
if it inspire confidence. It is settled that the testimony of a victim in cases of sexual
offence is vital and unless there is compelling reasons which necessitating looking for
corroboration of a statement, the Court should not find difficulty to act on the
testimony of victim alone on sexual assault to convict the accused. The deposition of
the prosecutrix thus to be taken as a whole. Needless to reiterate that the victim of
rape is not an accomplice and her evidence can be acted upon without corroboration.

She stands at a higher pedestral than an injured witness thus.

In the case of State of Himachal Pradesh Vs Raghubir Singh, reported in (1993)
2 SCC 622, the Hon'ble Apex Court held that there is no legal compulsion to look for
any other evidence to corroborate the evidence of the prosecutrix before recording an
order of conviction. Evidence has to be weighed and not counted. Conviction can be
recorded on the sole testimony of the prosecutrix, if her evidence inspire confidence
and there is absence of circumstances which mitigate her veracity. Thus, the law that
emerges on the issue is to the effect that statement of prosecutrix, if found to be
worthy of credence and reliable, requires no corroboration. The Court may convict the

accused on the sole testimony of the prosecutrix.

Further the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Wahid Khan Vs- State of
Madhya Pradesh reported in AIR 2010 SC 1, observed in paragraphs 21 and 22 as

follows:
11

“21.  /t 1s also a matter of common law that in Indian society any girl
or woman would not make such allegations against a person as
she Is fully aware of the reoercussions following therefrom. If
she Is found to be false, she would be looked by the society with
contempt throughout her life. For an unmarried girl, it will be
difficult to find a suitable groom. Therefore, unless an offence
has really be committed, a girl or a woman would be extremely
reluctant even to admit that any such inadent had taken jlace
Which Is likely to reflect on her chastity. She would also be
conscious of the danger of being ostracized by the society. /t
would indeed be difficult for her to survive in Indian society
Which Is, of course, not as forward looking as the western

countries are.

22. Thus, in a case of rape, testimony of a prosecutnix stands at par
with that of an injured witness. /t ls really not necessary to insist
for corroboration if the evidence of the prosecunx inspires

contidence and appears to be creaible.”

23. From the sequence of the evidence discussed above it reflect that as at the
time of occurrence the victim was alone in her house and at that time her younger
sister (PW 4) (aged 9 years) at that time was in the house and their mother was
taking bath at the back side of the house and father was absent who was in the
market. In such event the PW 4 was the best available witness in the occurrence and
her mother/PW 2 was the next available witness. PW 4 has clearly described the
incident that it was the two appellants who drag away her elder sister/ PW 3 from
inside the house towards the jungle then she made hue and cry and informed her
mother who was bathing at the rivulet backside the house. Sensing the foul play, PW 2
Immediately went to the back side of the house and found the accused appellants at
the place of occurrence as has been stated above. In such chain of events there

appears no any possibility of fabrication of any story on the part any of these
12

witnesses. PW 4 who is of very tender age of 9 years had no occasion for false
Implication of the accused appellants. The father of the victinyPW 1 was also apprised
immediately after the occurrence by his wife and in turn PW 1 informed the matter
over phone to PW 5 without any delay. The fact that the PW 5 was informed also
appears to be quite normal because such matter of sexual assault generally informed
to relatives rather than to outsiders. Although all the witnesses cross-examined at

length but nothing divulged so as to discredit the evidence of the witnesses.

24. The victim girl on the other hand is found to be minor one (below 18 years) at
the relevant point of time and she has sufficient maturity and explained all about the
matter. Her evidence does not suffer from any sort of infirmities to raise doubt about
the authenticity of her testimony. Nothing suggest about the consent of the victim
towards the affairs nor the credibility of her evidence is at stake, however she has
implicated the accused Ajay Bardhan as regards the rape, while initially both the
accused appellants dragged her outside the house towards the jungle. Accused
appellant Mukul Bardhan is stated to be of her father’s age. It is stated that she has no
knowledge if her father filed a case against Mukul Bardhan. In her detailed cross
examination she has specifically stated that there are sever pain on her right breast for
biting and doctor gave her treatment. The medical evidence also supported about the
finding of injury on her breast and private parts while it is said that there was
tenderness at the vagina and hymen was absent, along with injury on her breast. That
apart, she was minor at the relevant time. The type of injury found on the victim
indicative of sexual assault upon her at the time of incident and suggestive of sexual
Intercourse as revealed by the victim girl. The plea of the appellants abut enmity does
not sound well as the same has not been proved. Mere filing of a theft case cannot be

termed as an enmity between the parties and no father will file a false case at the risk
13

of his minor daughter as in the context of Indian Society, rape upon a woman is

always regarded as stigma.

25. In State of Punjab Vs. Gurmit Singh & Ors reported in AIR 1996 SC 1393,the
Hon’ble Supreme Court held that in cases involving sexual harassment, molestation
etc. the court is duty bound to deal with such cases with utmost sensitivity. Minor
contradictions or insignificant discrepancies in the statement of a prosecutrix should
not be a ground for throwing out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. Evidence of
the victim of sexual assault is enough for conviction and it does not require any
corroboration unless there are compelling reasons for seeking corroboration. The court
may look for some assurances of her statement to satisfy judicial conscience. The
statement of the prosecutrix is more reliable than that of an injured witness as she is

not an accomplice.

“In cases involving sexual molestation, Supposed considerations which
have no material effect on the veracity of the prosecution case or even
discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix should not, unless the
discrepancies are such which are of fatal nature, be allowed to throw
out an otherwise reliable prosecution case Seeking corroboration of her
statement before replying upon the same as a rule, in such cases,
amounts to adding insult to injury Corroboration as a condition for
judicial reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix is not a requirement

of law but a guidance of prudence under given circumstances.

XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXKXXKXKX = =  -XXXKKXKXXKXKX

The courts should examine the broader probabilities of a case
and not get swayed by minor contradictions or _ insignificant
discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix, which are not of a
fatal nature, to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. If
evidence of the prosecutrix inspires confidence, it must be relied upon

without seeking corroboration of her statement in material particulars. If
14

for some reason the court finds it difficult to place implicit reliance on
her testimony, it may look for evidence which may lend assurance to
her testimony, short of corroboration required in the case of an
accomplice. The testimony of the prosecutrix must be appreciated in the
background of the entire case and the trial court must be alive to its
responsibility and be sensitive while dealing with cases involving sexual
molestations. ""
26. In State of Orissa Vs. Thakara Besra & Anr. AIR 2002 SC 1963, it is held that
rape is not mere a physical assault, rather it often distracts the whole personality of
the victim. The rapist degrades the very soul of the helpless female and, therefore, the
testimony of the prosecutrix must be appreciated in the background of the entire case
and in such cases, non-examination even of other witnesses may not be a serious

infirmity in the prosecution case, particularly where the witnesses had not seen the

commission of offence.

2/. In the instant case as is evident from the matters on record both the accused
persons acted in concert by sharing a common intention while committing the offence.
The forceful entry in the house of the informant by both the accused appellants and
dragging the victim towards the back side of the house and another accused Mukul
Bardhan guarding the area with a dao in his hand while the other accused was
committing rape upon the victim, all these facets indicates that by a pre-arranged plan
the offence was committed. The conduct of the co-accused Mukul Bardhan comes
within the purview of section gang rape. Although the learned counsel for the
appellants has submitted that section 376 (2)(g) IPC refers to a different provisions i.e.
“commiting rape during communal and sectarian violence” which is not applicable to
the present case but it can be noted that the said provision is made under the

amended Act with effect from 3.2.2013 but having regard to the fact that the offence
15

committed prior to the amendment, the offence U/S 376 (2)(g) IPC “gang rape” will

come into play and the learned trial Court has dealt accordingly.

28. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Priya Patel vs State of M.P. and another
reported in AIR 2006 (SC) 2639 while dealing with the provision of Section 376 (2) (g)

IPC held as below:

“376. Punishment for rape (1) Whoever, except in the cases
provided for by sub-section (1), commits rape shall be punished
with imprisonment of either description for a term which shall
not be less than seven years but which may be for life or for a
term which may extend to ten years and shall also be liable to
fine unless the women raped is his own wife and is not under
twelve years of age, in which cases, he shall be punished with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend
to two years or with fine or with both:

Provided that the court may, for adequate and special reasons to
be mentioned in the judgment, impose a_ sentence of
imprisonment for a term of less than seven years.

(2) Whoever,-XX XX XX XX XX

(g) commits gang rape, shall be punished with rigorous
imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than ten years
but which may be for life and shall also be liable to fine:

Provided that the court may, for adequate and special reasons to
be mentioned in the judgment, impose a_ sentence of
imprisonment of either description for a term of less than ten
years, Explanation I.—

Where a woman is raped by one or more in a group of
persons acting in furtherance of their common intention, each of
the persons shall be deemed to have committed gang rape within
the meaning of this sub-section.

X XX XX Xx xx A bare reading of Section 375 makes the position
clear that rape can be committed only by a man. The section itself
provides as to when a man can be said to have committed rape.
Section 376(2) makes certain categories of serious cases of rape
as enumerated therein attract more severe punishment. One of
16

them relates to ""gang rape"". The language of sub-section (2)(g)
provides that ""whoever commits 'gang rape"" shall be punished
etc. The Explanation only clarifies that when a woman is raped
by one or more in a group of persons acting in furtherance of
their common intention each such person shall be deemed to have
committed gang rape within this sub-section (2). That cannot
make a woman guilty of committing rape. This is conceptually
inconceivable. The Explanation only indicates that when one or
more persons act in furtherance of their common intention to rape
a woman, each person of the group shall be deemed to have
committed gang rape. By operation of the deeming provision, a
person who has not actually committed rape is deemed to have
committed rape even if only one of the group in furtherance of
the common intention has committed rape. ""Common intention""
is dealt with in Section 34 IPC and provides that when a criminal
act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common
intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the
Same manner as if it was done by him alone. ""Common
intention"" denotes action in concert and necessarily postulates a
pre-arranged plan, a prior meeting of minds and an element of
participation in action. The acts may be different and vary in
character, but must be actuated by the same common intention,
which is different from same intention or similar intention. The
sine qua non for bringing in application of Section 34 IPC that
the act must be done in furtherance of the common intention to
do a criminal act. The expression ""in furtherance of their
common intention"" as appearing in the Explanation to Section
376(2) relates to intention to commit rape.”

29. As per the legal provision as well as the legal pronouncement discussed above
even though the co-accused Mukul Bardhan has not committed rape but by virtue of
such deeming provisions he is also guilty of the offence as he accompanied the other
accused in furtherance of common intention, knowing — fully well what has been
committed by the other accused. Section 34 IPC provides that- when a criminal act Is
done by several persons in furtherance of common intention of all, each of such
person is liable for the act in the same manner as if it was done by him alone. The
Section lays down a principle of joint liability in the doing of a criminal act. The
essence of that liability is to be found in the existence of common intention animating
the accused leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of such common

intention. Once it is found that a criminal act was done in furtherance of the common
17

intention of all, each of such person shall be liable for the criminal act as if it was done
by him alone. The learned trial Court has duly appreciated all matters on record in

proper perspective and calls for no interference.

In view of the findings and discussion above, the appeal is devoid of merit,

hence dismissed. Return the LCR.

}] UDGMENT & ORDER (CAV)
Heard Mr. HRA Choudhury, learned sr. counsel appearing for the appellants as

well as Mr. Bidyut Sarma, learned Addl. Public Prosecutor, Assam, for the Respondent
State.
2. This appeal has been preferred by the appellants against the judgment and
order dated 25.11.2013 passed by the learned Assistant Sessions J udge, Karimganj in
Sessions Case No. 37 of 2010 convicting the accused appellants U/Ss 448/376(2)(g)
IPC and sentencing them to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one years under
Section 448 of the India Penal Code, 1860 and further sentencing them to undergo
rigorous imprisonment for 10 (ten) years each under Section 376 (2)(g) IPC and fine
of Rs.5000/- each in default to undergo further rigorous impressments for two years.

Both the sentences will run concurrently.

3. The prosecution case _in brief is that on 7.9.2008 during evening time at about
6.00 pm, accused Ajay Bardhan and Mukul Bardhan in absence of informant Nidhu
Nath and his wife of village Goalpur abruptly trespassed into their house and they
forcibly dragged out the daughter of the informant after gagging her mouth with cloth
and showing dagger to her, while she was refilling kerosene oil in the hurricane lamp.
They dragged her to the jungle situated in the backside of the house of the informant,
and thereafter, accused Ajay Bardhan having removed wearing ‘saloar pant’ of the
victim girl forcibly committed sexual intercourse with her. He also caused bite injury on
her right breast after removing her top cloth. During that time accused Mukul Bardhan
was guarding with a dao on his hand. As soon as PW 2 Runubala Nath being the
mother of the victim girl heard alarm raised by her minor child, she immediately rushed
from the rivulet down their tilla homestead. The moment she arrived at the place of
occurrence both the accused persons run away. At night when the father of the victim
Nidhu Nath/informant (PW 1) returned home, the occurrence was reported to him by
his wife Runubala Nath. Thereafter the informant lodged an ejahar against the accused

at Patherkandi Police Station on 9.9.2008.
4. After receiving the ejahar the Officer-in-Charge of the Patherkandi Police
Station registered a case being Patherkandi Police Station Case No.138/2008 U/S
448/376/34 IPC. Thereafter the wheel of criminal investigation put into motion and
after completion of the investigation the investigating officer of the Patherkandi Police
Station case no. 138/08 submitted charge-sheet under Section 448/376 IPC against the

accused persons.

5. The case was committed by the learned J udicial Magistrate, 1 Class, Karimganj
to the Court of learned Sessions J udge, Karimganj who in turn transferred the records
of the G.R. Case No.783/08 to the Court of learned Assistant Sessions Judge,
Karimganj for trial. Both the accused persons stood the trial before the Court of

Assistant Sessions J udge, Karimganj in Sessions Case Noi.37/2010 U/S 448/376 IPC.

6. Thereafter the learned Assistant Sessions Judge, Karimganj framed charge
against both the accused persons U/S 448/376/34 IPC after hearing learned counsel
for both sides. The charges having been read and explained to the accused persons

both of them pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.

7. The prosecution examined as many as 8 (eight) witnesses and exhibited
altogether six documents. The defence examined 3(three) witnesses. Upon closure of
evidence of prosecution side both the accused persons/ appellants were examined U/S

313 CrPC.

8. At the conclusion of trial the accused persons were held guilty and convicted
them U/S 448/376/34 IPC as aforesaid. Being aggrieved with the aforesaid judgment,

the present appeal has been preferred.

9, The learned senior counsel Mr. HRA Choudhury in his argument has urged

before this Court that the prosecution case is under the shadow of doubt due to
variety of reasons such as there was earlier enmity between the parties as the
informant has filed theft (of goat)case as against the petitioner and the evidence of
mother of the victim that she immediately appeared at the place of occurrence is not
at all true as she was taking bath at rivulet which is at a distance from their house.
Further it contends that the allegation about the involvement of both the accused
petitioners is highly improbable as accused Mukul Bardhan is brother in law of the
accused Ajay Bardhan and no person will indulge in such matter of sexual assault
along with his own brother in law. Further it is submitted that the evidence of PW 3
(being the sister of victim) and PW 5 (being the relative) is not at all reliable. Referring
to the evidence of the medical officer it has been canvassed that there being no finding
of sexual intercourse upon the victim it also belies the allegation of rape and the

accused appellants are entitled to get benefit of all lapse in the prosecution story.

10. Per contra, the learned Addl. P.P.Mr. B.Sarma has vehemently submitted that
the evidence of each and every witness is more than convincing so as to prove the
guilt of the accused to the heel and the authenticity of the witnesses remained
unshaken throughout the cross examination at length. Examination of immediate
available witness, which may be the relative to the victim is the necessity of
prosecution case, instead of counting the number of witnesses that could have been
examined by the prosecution who might have arrived much after the incident.
Furthermore it has also been contended that the evidence of MO in totality is sufficient
to infer the sexual assault upon the victim girl, even though no specific opinion has
been rendered by the M O about sexual intercourse. The fact that the victim girl is, a
minor one is another vital aspect deserves consideration, as to the necessity for false
Implication of a person by the victim by relieving the actual assailant, while she has

suffered sufficient physical injury in the incident. Thus according to the learned Addl.
P.P. the learned Court has properly appreciated all the evidence on record and rightly

held the accused petitioner guilty under the law.

11. Having regard to the submission made above, let us appreciate the evidence on
record. Parents of the victim have deposed their evidence as PW 1, PW 2 and PW 3is
the victim, PW 4 is the younger sister of the victim and PW 5 is the independent

witness and others are medical officer and investigating officer.

12. Let us first appreciate the evidence of PW 3 (victim) who has _ deposed in her
evidence that on the day of occurrence when she was filling kerosene oil in the lamp
In the evening hours at their house and at that time her father was at market and her
mother also went to take bath at the back side of their house at chara (rivulet). At that
time accused Ajay Verdhan trespassed into their house and dragged her to the jungle
situated towards back side of their house and accused Mukul Bardhan was standing at
the Verandha of their house armed with a dao in his hand. She further stated that in
the jungle accused Mukul Bardhan was guarding her and accused Ajay Bardhan did
Intercourse with her inserting his penis into her vagina after removing her wearing
cloth (chaloar pant). Accused Ajay Bardhan also removed her top (upper portion of the
cloth) caused injury on her right breast by biting and as a result she sustained severe
Injury with bleeding. While Ajay Bardhan dragged her towards’ the jungle, her
younger sister raised alarm and her mother arrived with a lathi and noticing arrival of
her mother at the place of occurrence, both the accused fled away. She was then
taken to home back by her mother and applied certain pan juice on the injured
portion of her right breast. At around 8.00 PM when her father returned home then her
mother disclosed him the entire matter. Her father then informed the matter to his

neighbours and she was taken to Patherkandi Police Station on the next morning by
her father. Police then sent them to Karimganj Civil Hospital for her medical

examination and treatment.

In cross examination, she stated that accused appellant Ajay Bardhan and
Mukul Bardhan took her away by holding her hands and legs at the relevant time to
the place of occurrence then her brother and sister were raising alarm. The rivulet
where her mother was taking bath was situated at a distance of 150 meters ( approx)
toward east down their till homestead and the place of occurrence is about 5/6 Nal
away from their house. She stated that accused Mukul Bardhan is the brother-in-law of
accused Ajay Bardhan. She further explained that as soon as the accused persons
were lifting her from the house, her brother and sister instantly ran to her mother (PW
2) at rivulet and inform the matter. It is stated that for around 10 minutes the
accused committed the sexual intercourse. She did not know if her father lodged any

theft case against Mukul Bardhan.

13. M other of the victim, Runu Bala Nath/PW 2 has testified that four years back
on the day of occurrence while she was taking bath at rivulet, hearing hue and cry
raised by her younger daughter (PW 4), she arrived at her homestead. PW 4 reported
her about dragging of the victim ( P W 3) by the accused appellants towards back side
of their homestead, then she immediately rushed to the backside jungle and
witnessed that accused Mukul Bardhan was standing with dao on his hand and accused
Ajay Bardhan was lying on the body of the victim and she _ noticed that
pant/blouse/skirt of her daughter were removed. Seeing her both the accused ran
away and she brought back PW 3 to home. She narrated the incident to her husband
on his return home at night and then her husband informed the matter to the
neighbour and then to police and next morning victim was taken to Patharkandi

police Station. In her cross examination she has reaffirmed what she deposed in her
examination-in-chief and narrated more details of the occurrence, that she found the

pantry of her daughter lying on the ground, top of the girl also blood strained.

14. PW 1, father of victim /informant deposed that on the day of occurrence when
he returned home from the market at about 9/9.30 pm his wife and his daughter PW 3
narrated the incident of rape by the accused appellant Ajay Barman and duly guarded
by accused Mukul Barman. At the relevant time his 9 years daughter Anit (PW 4) was
present at his house and his wife was bathing at rivulet. Thereafter he informed the
matter to Gunomoi Nath (PW 5), Monoi Natha, Bimal Suklabaidya. On the next day he
lodged Ejahar before the Patharkandi Police Station and the police forwarded his
daughter (PW 3) to Karimganj Civil Hospital for medical examination. During cross
examination this witness stated that police having witnessed the oozing of bleeding
Injury from her right breast and sent her to Karimganj Civil Hospital for medical
examination. He replied that at first his wife narrated the incident and thereafter his
daughter to him. He also narrated that place of occurrence is a jungle covered by
grass, trees and bushes and is situated 7/8 nals from his house. He also replied that
prior to the occurrence both the accused appellants had stolen his goat and killed it for

flesh for which he filed an FIR against them.

15. PW 4, Smti Ami Nat (aged 13 years) deposed on 10.4.2013 that she knew
accused appellants who were their neighbours. The occurrence took place about 4/5
years back and on a certain day of evening when she was at home and her elder sister
Suparna Nath was also present, however her parents were not at home then accused
appellants Ajay Bardhan and Mukul Bardhan went to their house and forcibly dragged
her elder sister when she was pouring kerosene oil at a hurricane. She immediately

raised alarm and ran to her mother who was taking bath at rivulet informed the matter
and then her mother immediately arrived home and went to the place of occurrence

and brought back the victim.

16. PW 5 Sri Gunomoni Nath is a neighbour, in his examination in chief he deposed
that about 5 years back, on certain night, Nidhu Nath (PW 1) father of the victim
informed him over telephone stating that accused appellants dragged his daughter
(victim) from his house and did bad works with her. PW 1 requested him to visit his
house but as it was night so expressed his inability to go their house. Then the PW 1
along with one Monuj Nath (since expired) came to his house and informed the matter
In details and requested him to hold a village bichar and he advised them to approach
the elderly villagers. He replied in cross examination that his house is about % Km

away from the house of the informant and he Is a distant relative of the informant.

17. The victim was examined by the PW 6 Dr. Sibnath Paul as on 8.9.2008 and on
physical examination he found circular type of teeth bite 1 4%” x Y%” on the right
breast above the right axial with tenderness in the vaginal area and hymen was
absent. However, no spermatozoa were found in vaginal swab. Her age is below 18
years, Vide Ext. 3 is medical report, vide Ext.4 is the vaginal swab report, Ext. 5 is Xray Plat. It transpires that PW 6 has exhibited the report for and on behalf of the
doctor Swapan Kr. Sen as said doctor was transferred, but subsequently said doctor
Swapan Kr. Sen was also examined as PW 8 and hence the evidence of PW 6 and PW
8 are exactly same. Moreover the PW 8 in cross examination has clarified after
verifying the radiological photograph/ X-ray report of the victim, he wrote the report to

the certificate.

18. Lastly, PW 7 Abdur Rahman Laskar has testified all about the investigation that

has been conducted by the earlier |.0.(since expired) and has stated that about
collection of the medical report and recording of witnesses as well as filing of charge
sheet. No any serious contradiction of any witness has been proved through the |O

DEFENCE EVIDNCE

19. In support of plea of denial defence examined three witness those are DW 1
Niranjan Malakar, DW 2 Dhiraj Deb and DW 3 Smti J unu Deb. It is to be noted that in
their casual statement DW 1 simply stated that he went to the house of Mukul Bardhan
In the evening at 7.30 PM to attend “Baishnab Sewa” on the occasion of shradha
ceremony of the mother of Mukul Bardhan and there was Kirtan from 7.30 PM to 10.30
PM in his house but in the answer to the Court he has replied that he did not know
what happened prior to 6.30 PM in the house Nidhu (informant). DW 3 also stated to
have attended in the said Kirtan in the House of Mukul Bardhan in the evening, while

the DW 2 has stated that he did not know anything about the occurrence.

20. Obviously such type of vague evidence is of no help to the defence as the
witnesses were not at all specific that for the reason of such shradha ceremony in the
house of Mukul Bardhan it was not possible on the part of Mukul Bardhan as well as
Ajay Bardhan (his brother in law) to involve in the incident. It is also admitted that

they cannot say about any incident prior to 6.30 PM and such evidence bears no value.

21. In the present case the incident happened at about 6 PM which is not even fully
dark evening in the month of September (date of occurrence 7.9.2008) as stated by
the witnesses. Looking into statement of the victim /PW 3 it can be safely held that she
has been ravished sexually by force against her wishes and her testimony got support
of the medical report. That being so, the argument of the appellants’ side, regarding
false implication of the accused appellants is not found maintainable. It is not a case of

consensus sexual affairs between the parties and the proof of age of prosecutrix is
10

irrelevant. Nothing emerges to discredit the evidence of the victim girl as well as other

evidence on record.

22. The law is more or less settled on the proposition that relying on the sole
testimony of prosecutrix in an offence of rape U/S 376 IPC conviction can be sustained
if it inspire confidence. It is settled that the testimony of a victim in cases of sexual
offence is vital and unless there is compelling reasons which necessitating looking for
corroboration of a statement, the Court should not find difficulty to act on the
testimony of victim alone on sexual assault to convict the accused. The deposition of
the prosecutrix thus to be taken as a whole. Needless to reiterate that the victim of
rape is not an accomplice and her evidence can be acted upon without corroboration.

She stands at a higher pedestral than an injured witness thus.

In the case of State of Himachal Pradesh Vs Raghubir Singh, reported in (1993)
2 SCC 622, the Hon'ble Apex Court held that there is no legal compulsion to look for
any other evidence to corroborate the evidence of the prosecutrix before recording an
order of conviction. Evidence has to be weighed and not counted. Conviction can be
recorded on the sole testimony of the prosecutrix, if her evidence inspire confidence
and there is absence of circumstances which mitigate her veracity. Thus, the law that
emerges on the issue is to the effect that statement of prosecutrix, if found to be
worthy of credence and reliable, requires no corroboration. The Court may convict the

accused on the sole testimony of the prosecutrix.

Further the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Wahid Khan Vs- State of
Madhya Pradesh reported in AIR 2010 SC 1, observed in paragraphs 21 and 22 as

follows:
11

“21.  /t 1s also a matter of common law that in Indian society any girl
or woman would not make such allegations against a person as
she Is fully aware of the reoercussions following therefrom. If
she Is found to be false, she would be looked by the society with
contempt throughout her life. For an unmarried girl, it will be
difficult to find a suitable groom. Therefore, unless an offence
has really be committed, a girl or a woman would be extremely
reluctant even to admit that any such inadent had taken jlace
Which Is likely to reflect on her chastity. She would also be
conscious of the danger of being ostracized by the society. /t
would indeed be difficult for her to survive in Indian society
Which Is, of course, not as forward looking as the western

countries are.

22. Thus, in a case of rape, testimony of a prosecutnix stands at par
with that of an injured witness. /t ls really not necessary to insist
for corroboration if the evidence of the prosecunx inspires

contidence and appears to be creaible.”

23. From the sequence of the evidence discussed above it reflect that as at the
time of occurrence the victim was alone in her house and at that time her younger
sister (PW 4) (aged 9 years) at that time was in the house and their mother was
taking bath at the back side of the house and father was absent who was in the
market. In such event the PW 4 was the best available witness in the occurrence and
her mother/PW 2 was the next available witness. PW 4 has clearly described the
incident that it was the two appellants who drag away her elder sister/ PW 3 from
inside the house towards the jungle then she made hue and cry and informed her
mother who was bathing at the rivulet backside the house. Sensing the foul play, PW 2
Immediately went to the back side of the house and found the accused appellants at
the place of occurrence as has been stated above. In such chain of events there

appears no any possibility of fabrication of any story on the part any of these
12

witnesses. PW 4 who is of very tender age of 9 years had no occasion for false
Implication of the accused appellants. The father of the victinyPW 1 was also apprised
immediately after the occurrence by his wife and in turn PW 1 informed the matter
over phone to PW 5 without any delay. The fact that the PW 5 was informed also
appears to be quite normal because such matter of sexual assault generally informed
to relatives rather than to outsiders. Although all the witnesses cross-examined at

length but nothing divulged so as to discredit the evidence of the witnesses.

24. The victim girl on the other hand is found to be minor one (below 18 years) at
the relevant point of time and she has sufficient maturity and explained all about the
matter. Her evidence does not suffer from any sort of infirmities to raise doubt about
the authenticity of her testimony. Nothing suggest about the consent of the victim
towards the affairs nor the credibility of her evidence is at stake, however she has
implicated the accused Ajay Bardhan as regards the rape, while initially both the
accused appellants dragged her outside the house towards the jungle. Accused
appellant Mukul Bardhan is stated to be of her father’s age. It is stated that she has no
knowledge if her father filed a case against Mukul Bardhan. In her detailed cross
examination she has specifically stated that there are sever pain on her right breast for
biting and doctor gave her treatment. The medical evidence also supported about the
finding of injury on her breast and private parts while it is said that there was
tenderness at the vagina and hymen was absent, along with injury on her breast. That
apart, she was minor at the relevant time. The type of injury found on the victim
indicative of sexual assault upon her at the time of incident and suggestive of sexual
Intercourse as revealed by the victim girl. The plea of the appellants abut enmity does
not sound well as the same has not been proved. Mere filing of a theft case cannot be

termed as an enmity between the parties and no father will file a false case at the risk
13

of his minor daughter as in the context of Indian Society, rape upon a woman is

always regarded as stigma.

25. In State of Punjab Vs. Gurmit Singh & Ors reported in AIR 1996 SC 1393,the
Hon’ble Supreme Court held that in cases involving sexual harassment, molestation
etc. the court is duty bound to deal with such cases with utmost sensitivity. Minor
contradictions or insignificant discrepancies in the statement of a prosecutrix should
not be a ground for throwing out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. Evidence of
the victim of sexual assault is enough for conviction and it does not require any
corroboration unless there are compelling reasons for seeking corroboration. The court
may look for some assurances of her statement to satisfy judicial conscience. The
statement of the prosecutrix is more reliable than that of an injured witness as she is

not an accomplice.

“In cases involving sexual molestation, Supposed considerations which
have no material effect on the veracity of the prosecution case or even
discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix should not, unless the
discrepancies are such which are of fatal nature, be allowed to throw
out an otherwise reliable prosecution case Seeking corroboration of her
statement before replying upon the same as a rule, in such cases,
amounts to adding insult to injury Corroboration as a condition for
judicial reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix is not a requirement

of law but a guidance of prudence under given circumstances.

XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXKXXKXKX = =  -XXXKKXKXXKXKX

The courts should examine the broader probabilities of a case
and not get swayed by minor contradictions or _ insignificant
discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix, which are not of a
fatal nature, to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. If
evidence of the prosecutrix inspires confidence, it must be relied upon

without seeking corroboration of her statement in material particulars. If
14

for some reason the court finds it difficult to place implicit reliance on
her testimony, it may look for evidence which may lend assurance to
her testimony, short of corroboration required in the case of an
accomplice. The testimony of the prosecutrix must be appreciated in the
background of the entire case and the trial court must be alive to its
responsibility and be sensitive while dealing with cases involving sexual
molestations. ""
26. In State of Orissa Vs. Thakara Besra & Anr. AIR 2002 SC 1963, it is held that
rape is not mere a physical assault, rather it often distracts the whole personality of
the victim. The rapist degrades the very soul of the helpless female and, therefore, the
testimony of the prosecutrix must be appreciated in the background of the entire case
and in such cases, non-examination even of other witnesses may not be a serious

infirmity in the prosecution case, particularly where the witnesses had not seen the

commission of offence.

2/. In the instant case as is evident from the matters on record both the accused
persons acted in concert by sharing a common intention while committing the offence.
The forceful entry in the house of the informant by both the accused appellants and
dragging the victim towards the back side of the house and another accused Mukul
Bardhan guarding the area with a dao in his hand while the other accused was
committing rape upon the victim, all these facets indicates that by a pre-arranged plan
the offence was committed. The conduct of the co-accused Mukul Bardhan comes
within the purview of section gang rape. Although the learned counsel for the
appellants has submitted that section 376 (2)(g) IPC refers to a different provisions i.e.
“commiting rape during communal and sectarian violence” which is not applicable to
the present case but it can be noted that the said provision is made under the

amended Act with effect from 3.2.2013 but having regard to the fact that the offence
15

committed prior to the amendment, the offence U/S 376 (2)(g) IPC “gang rape” will

come into play and the learned trial Court has dealt accordingly.

28. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Priya Patel vs State of M.P. and another
reported in AIR 2006 (SC) 2639 while dealing with the provision of Section 376 (2) (g)

IPC held as below:

“376. Punishment for rape (1) Whoever, except in the cases
provided for by sub-section (1), commits rape shall be punished
with imprisonment of either description for a term which shall
not be less than seven years but which may be for life or for a
term which may extend to ten years and shall also be liable to
fine unless the women raped is his own wife and is not under
twelve years of age, in which cases, he shall be punished with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend
to two years or with fine or with both:

Provided that the court may, for adequate and special reasons to
be mentioned in the judgment, impose a_ sentence of
imprisonment for a term of less than seven years.

(2) Whoever,-XX XX XX XX XX

(g) commits gang rape, shall be punished with rigorous
imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than ten years
but which may be for life and shall also be liable to fine:

Provided that the court may, for adequate and special reasons to
be mentioned in the judgment, impose a_ sentence of
imprisonment of either description for a term of less than ten
years, Explanation I.—

Where a woman is raped by one or more in a group of
persons acting in furtherance of their common intention, each of
the persons shall be deemed to have committed gang rape within
the meaning of this sub-section.

X XX XX Xx xx A bare reading of Section 375 makes the position
clear that rape can be committed only by a man. The section itself
provides as to when a man can be said to have committed rape.
Section 376(2) makes certain categories of serious cases of rape
as enumerated therein attract more severe punishment. One of
16

them relates to ""gang rape"". The language of sub-section (2)(g)
provides that ""whoever commits 'gang rape"" shall be punished
etc. The Explanation only clarifies that when a woman is raped
by one or more in a group of persons acting in furtherance of
their common intention each such person shall be deemed to have
committed gang rape within this sub-section (2). That cannot
make a woman guilty of committing rape. This is conceptually
inconceivable. The Explanation only indicates that when one or
more persons act in furtherance of their common intention to rape
a woman, each person of the group shall be deemed to have
committed gang rape. By operation of the deeming provision, a
person who has not actually committed rape is deemed to have
committed rape even if only one of the group in furtherance of
the common intention has committed rape. ""Common intention""
is dealt with in Section 34 IPC and provides that when a criminal
act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common
intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the
Same manner as if it was done by him alone. ""Common
intention"" denotes action in concert and necessarily postulates a
pre-arranged plan, a prior meeting of minds and an element of
participation in action. The acts may be different and vary in
character, but must be actuated by the same common intention,
which is different from same intention or similar intention. The
sine qua non for bringing in application of Section 34 IPC that
the act must be done in furtherance of the common intention to
do a criminal act. The expression ""in furtherance of their
common intention"" as appearing in the Explanation to Section
376(2) relates to intention to commit rape.”

29. As per the legal provision as well as the legal pronouncement discussed above
even though the co-accused Mukul Bardhan has not committed rape but by virtue of
such deeming provisions he is also guilty of the offence as he accompanied the other
accused in furtherance of common intention, knowing — fully well what has been
committed by the other accused. Section 34 IPC provides that- when a criminal act Is
done by several persons in furtherance of common intention of all, each of such
person is liable for the act in the same manner as if it was done by him alone. The
Section lays down a principle of joint liability in the doing of a criminal act. The
essence of that liability is to be found in the existence of common intention animating
the accused leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of such common

intention. Once it is found that a criminal act was done in furtherance of the common
17

intention of all, each of such person shall be liable for the criminal act as if it was done
by him alone. The learned trial Court has duly appreciated all matters on record in

proper perspective and calls for no interference.

In view of the findings and discussion above, the appeal is devoid of merit,

hence dismissed. Return the LCR.

HON’BLE MRS. No.82 of 2017

For the Petitioner: Mr. S. Borgohain, Advocate
In Cri. 28 of 2012 against said two accused person Dharma Dutta and Sarbananda Mali. During the trial prosecution examined... number of witnesses and subsequently
by the order dated 9.5.2013 the learned Special J udge took cognizance against three
police officers namely, Hemanta Kumar Das, the then Addl. The scope of direction for re-investigation has been dealt with in the aforesaid
decisions and it has been categorically held that the Magistrate before whom a report
U/S 173 (2) of the Code is filed is empowered in law to direct further investigation and
required the police to submit a further or a supplementary report. As regards the requirement of section U/S 197 CrPC the Hon’blle Apex Court in
Surinderjit Singh (Supra) has observed that sanction U/S 197 CrPC and or sanction
required under a Special Statute (as postulated under Section 19 of the Prevention of
Corruption Act, 1988 is mandatory pre-requisite even when cognizance is taken under
Section 319 CrPC. 498 of 2013 dated 23.1.2015, wherein this Court has set aside the impugned order

of an accused pending investigation or when report is, filed
to wipe out the report and its effects in law. Where there
is a specific order made by the court for reasons like the
investigation being entirely unfair, tainted, undesirable or
being based upon no truth, the court would have to
specifically direct that the investigation or proceedings so
conducted shall stand cancelled and will not form part of the

|] UDGMENT & ORDER (CAV)

All the above petitions, challenge has been made to the proceeding of Special
Case No. 28 of 2012 pending in the Court of Special Judge, Assam, Guwahati and
certain orders thereof, hence all the cases are taken up together for disposal by way of

this common judgment and order.

2. The facts in nutshell is that one A.K.Trivedi, A.C.S., lodged an FIR before the
Officer-in-Charge, Kokrajhar Police Station on 2.6.2006 stating inter alia that the
Platoon Commandant of Home Guard Office, Kokrajhar have cheated several other
Homeguards. Accordingly, Kokrajhar P.S.Case No.137/06 U/S 7 of the Prevention of
Corruption Act, 1988 was registered. On completion of the investigation police
submitted final report as on 14.12.2011 and then the learned Special J udge served
notice upon the informant to file his response. Thereafter, by an order dated 9.1.2012
the learned Special J udge rejected the final report and directed the S.P., Kokrajhar to
re-investigate the case and submit appropriate report. In pursuance to the aforesaid
order reinvestigation was carried out and chargesheet was submitted against
Dharmaduttta Rava and Sarbananda Mali U/S 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act and
the Court upon taking cognizance of the offence proceeded for trial in Special Case No.

28 of 2012 against said two accused person Dharma Dutta and Sarbananda Mali.

3. During the trial prosecution examined... number of witnesses and subsequently
by the order dated 9.5.2013 the learned Special J udge took cognizance against three
police officers namely, Hemanta Kumar Das, the then Addl. S.P.Kokrajhar, Prasanta
Kumar Dutta, the then S.P.Kokrajhar and Sri Abdus Shubhan Laskar the then |.O.of the
said case U/S 120B/217/218 IPC with the following observation:

“Thus from the evidence of PW 13 Sri Abdus Shubhan Laskar and the
case diary it appears that the then Addl. S.P., Kokrajhar, Sri Hementa
Kumar Das and Sri Prasanta Kumar Das, S.P. Kokrajhar made conspiracy

with investigating officer Sri Abdus Shulbhan Laskar to save the accused
persons namely, Dharmadutta Rava, Platoon Commandant and Havildar
Sarvananda Mali from legal punishment and all of them disobeyed the
direction of law as to the way in which they were to conduct themselves
as supervising and investigating police officials leading to filing of final
report in favour of the two accused persons who had alleged taken
illegal gratification at the rate of Rs.2000/- to Rs.5000/- from 31
Homeguards Trainees assuring them to get them depoloyed. Prima facie
there are incriminating materials against those senior police officer U/S
120B/217/218 IPC. Accordingly, cognizance is taken against them and

issued Summons to them.”

4. Challenging the aforesaid order for taking cognizance two above named
petitioners Prasanata Kumar Dutta and Hemanta Kumar Das have preferred the
Criminal Petition No.637/13 and Criminal Petition No. 638/13 on the twin grounds that
the order of taking cognizance on the basis of re-investigation conducted by the
investigating officer is itself bad in law and further taking of cognizance only on the
basis of evidence of |.0. without obtaining sanction U/S 197 CrPC (the petitioners
being the superior police officers discharging their duties while conducting the

Investigation) is bad in law and hence cannot sustain.

5. The learned counsel for the petitioner, Mr. S. Borgohain vehemently contended
that there is express bar on the part of the Court to direct for reinvestigation and
order of taking cognizance without prosecution sanction against the officials
discharging official duties is itself illegal. Mr. Buragohain heavily relied upon the
decision of Hon’ble Apex Court reported in (2009) 6 SCC 332 Mithabhai Pashabhai
Patel & ors-vs- State of Gujarat; (2013) 5 SCC 762 Vinay Tyagi -vs- Irshad Ali @
Deepak and ors and (2016) 8 SCC 722 Surinderjit Singh Mand and another -vs- State

of Punjab and another.

6. The scope of direction for re-investigation has been dealt with in the aforesaid
decisions and it has been categorically held that the Magistrate before whom a report
U/S 173 (2) of the Code is filed is empowered in law to direct further investigation and
required the police to submit a further or a supplementary report. The reinvestigation
being forbidden in law, no superior Court would ordinarily issue direction for
reinvestigation. In Vinay Tyagi (Supra) in paragraph 40.1 it has been held that - “ the

Magistrate has no power to direct reinvestigation or fresh investigation (de novo) in
the case initiated on the basis of police report. In paragraph 40.2 it has been held
that- “the Magistrate has the power to direct further investigation after filing of a police
report in terms of Section 173 (6) of the Code.

7. As regards the requirement of section U/S 197 CrPC the Hon’blle Apex Court in
Surinderjit Singh (Supra) has observed that sanction U/S 197 CrPC and or sanction
required under a Special Statute (as postulated under Section 19 of the Prevention of
Corruption Act, 1988 is mandatory pre-requisite even when cognizance is taken under
Section 319 CrPC. Further it is held that determination rendered by Court U/S 319 CrPC
IS not subservient to the decision of competent authority U/S 197 as order granting or

declaring sanction can be achieved by taking recourse to judicial review.

3. Attention of this Court is drawn to the decision of this Court in Criminal Petition
No. 498 of 2013 dated 23.1.2015, wherein this Court has set aside the impugned order
dated 9.5.2013 as regards the other accused petitioner Abdush Subhan Laskar and it
has been contended that the present two petitioners i.e. Sri Hemanta Kumar Das and
Sri Prasanta Kumar Dutta being similarly situated be given the same benefit under the

same circumstances.

9, | have considered the submission of Mr. Borgohian, the learned counsel for the
petitioners and Mr. H. Sarma, learned Addl. P.P., Assam. It has been fairly submitted
by the learned Addl.P.P. that the present two petitioners who have challenged the
Same impugned order which has already been set aside as against one petitioner
Abdush Subhan Laskar and as_ the present petitioners are similarly situated the benefit
of said order can be extended to the present two petitioners also. As is apparent that
the case of present two petitioners is squarely covered by the aforesaid decision and
hence, they deserve the same benefit. Accordingly the impugned order dated 9.5.2013
as regards the present two petitioners Sri Hemanta Kumar Das and Sri Prasanta Kumar

Dutta is hereby set aside.

10. Now we are left to the Criminal Petition No. 82 of 2017 filed by the petitioner
Sri Sarbananda Mali who has challenged the case on the ground that the aforesaid
Special Case No. 28 of 2012 is bad in law as the learned Special J udge has illegally
directed for re-investigation, refusing to accept the final report which is wholly bad in

law. It has been contended that the further proceeding of the aforesaid case being
iIlegal, unjust and without authority of law which has resulted the abuse of the process
of Court.

11. The learned senior counsel for the petitioner Mr. K.K.Mahanta has also referred
and relied upon the same citations that have been discussed above, wherein the
Hon'ble Apex Court has unanimously declared that the Magistrate has no power to
direct for re-investigation save and except, Court is empowered to direct for further

investigation.

In this context let us reproduce the relevant observations of the

Hon'ble Supreme Court in Vinay Tyagi case (Supra):

“23. However, in the case of a ‘fresh investigation’,
‘reinvestigation’ or ‘de novo investigation’ there has to be a
definite order of the court. The order of the Court
unambiguously should state as to whether the previous
investigation, for reasons to be recorded, is incapable of
being acted upon. Neither the Investigating agency nor the
Magistrate has any power to order or conduct ‘fresh
investigation’. This is primarily for the reason that it would
be opposed to the scheme of the Code. It is essential that
even an order of ‘fresh’/’de novo’ investigation passed by the
higher judiciary should always be coupled with a specific
direction as to the fate of the investigation already
conducted. The cases where such direction can be issued are
few and far between. This is based upon a fundamental
principle of our criminal jurisprudence which is that it is the
right of a suspect or an accused to have a just and fair
investigation and trial. This principle flows from the
constitutional mandate contained in Articles 21 and 22 of the
Constitution of India. Where the investigation ex facie is
unfair, tainted, mala fide and smacks of foul play, the courts
would set aside such an investigation and direct fresh or de
novo investigation and, if necessary, even by another
independent investigating agency. As already noticed, this is
a power of wide plenitude and, therefore, has to be exercised
sparingly. The principle of rarest of rare cases would
squarely apply to such cases. Unless the unfairness of the
investigation is such that it pricks the judicial conscience of
the Court, the Court should be reluctant to interfere in such
matters to the extent of quashing an investigation and
directing a ‘fresh investigation’.

28. The Next question that comes up for consideration of this
Court is whether the empowered Magistrate has _ the
jurisdiction to direct ‘further investigation’ or ‘fresh
investigation’. As far as the latter is concerned, the law
declared by this Court consistently is that the learned
Magistrate has no jurisdiction to direct ‘fresh’ or ‘de novo’
investigation. However, once the report is filed, the
Magistrate has jurisdiction to accept the report or reject the
same right at the threshold. Even after accepting the report,
it has the jurisdiction to discharge the accused or frame the
charge and put him to trial. But there are no provisions in
the Code which empower the Magistrate to disturb the status
of an accused pending investigation or when report is, filed
to wipe out the report and its effects in law.

38. However, having given our considered thought to the
principles stated in these judgments, we are of the view that
the Magistrate before whom a report under Section 173(2) of
the Code is filed, is empowered in law to direct ‘further
investigation’ and require the police to submit a further or a
supplementary report. A three Judge Bench of this Court in
the case of Bhagwant Singh (supra) has, in no uncertain
terms, stated that principle, as afore-noticed.

40. Having analysed the provisions of the Code and the
various judgments as afore-indicated, we would state the
following conclusions in regard to the powers of a magistrate
in terms of Section 173(2) read with Section 173(8) and
Section 156(3) of the Code :

40.1. The Magistrate has no power to direct ‘reinvestigation’
or ‘fresh investigation’ (de novo) in the case initiated on the
basis of a police report.

40.2. A Magistrate has the power to direct ‘further
investigation’ after filing of a police report in terms of
Section 173(6) of the Code.

40.3. The view expressed in (2) above is in conformity with
the principle of law stated in Bhagwant Singh’s case (supra)
by a three Judge Bench and thus in conformity with the
doctrine of precedence.

43. At this stage, we may also state another well-settled
canon of criminal jurisprudence that the superior courts
have the jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code or even
Article 226 of the Constitution of India to direct ‘further
investigation’, ‘fresh’ or ‘de novo’ and_ even
‘reinvestigation’. ‘Fresh’, ‘de novo’, and ‘reinvestigation’
are synonymous expressions and their result in law would be
the same. The superior courts are even vested with the power
of transferring investigation from one agency to another,
provided the ends of justice so demand such action. Of
course, it is also a settled principle that this power has to be
exercised by the superior courts very sparingly and with
great circumspection.

45. The power to order/direct ‘reinvestigation’ or ‘de novo’
investigation falls in the domain of higher courts, that too in
exceptional cases. If one examines the provisions of the
Code, there is no specific provision for cancellation of the
reports, except that the investigating agency can file a
closure report (where according to the investigating agency,
no offence is made out). Even such a report is subject to
acceptance by the learned Magistrate who, in his wisdom,
may or may not accept such a report. For valid reasons, the
Court may, by declining to accept such a report, direct
‘further investigation’, or even on the basis of the record of
the case and the documents annexed thereto, summon the
accused.

46. The Code does not contain any provision which deals
with the court competent to direct ‘fresh investigation’, the
situation in which such investigation can be conducted, if at
all, and finally the manner in which the report so obtained
shall be dealt with. The superior courts can direct conduct of
a ‘fresh’/‘de novo’ investigation, but unless it specifically
directs that the report already prepared or the investigation
so far conducted will not form part of the record of the case,
such report would be deemed to be part of the record. Once
it is part of the record, the learned Magistrate has no
jurisdiction to exclude the same from the record of the case.
In other words, but for a specific order by the superior court,
the reports, whether a primary report or a report upon
‘further investigation’ or a report upon ‘fresh investigation’,
shall have to be construed and read conjointly. Where there
is a specific order made by the court for reasons like the
investigation being entirely unfair, tainted, undesirable or
being based upon no truth, the court would have to
specifically direct that the investigation or proceedings so
conducted shall stand cancelled and will not form part of the
record for consideration by the Court of competent
jurisdiction. “

12. In the instant case, the learned Court directed for reinvestigation which is
beyond its jurisdiction and on the basis of such reinvestigation charge-sheet has been
filed and trial proceeded and as such, entire proceeding culminated into gross illegality
which now cannot be cured. Such an illegality has vitiated the whole trial and any

further proceeding of the aforesaid case will be nothing but abuse of the process of

law and will also result in injustice.
13. In the light of the above, and the reasons recorded the petition filed by the
petitioner Sri Sarbananda Mali stands allowed. In the result, the entire proceeding
pertaining to the Special Case No. 28 of 2012 pending in the Court of Special J udge,
Assam, Guwahati stands quashed and set aside. All the petitions stands disposed

accordingly. Return the LCR.

her out from his house for not meeting his demand of money in full. He
also heard about the abortion of the child of the victim/PW1. The accused appellant sent some persons to take her back
although she did not come back. In his cross-examination, he is found to have
stated that the accused appellant neither tortured the victim/PWI1 nor

demanded money from her. 18) Substantiating the suggestions of the defence put to the PW2, this

mother of the victim/PW1, herself deposed that the victim/PW1 came to
their house and did not return inspite of receipt of legal notice for

Public Prosecutor, for the state respondent.

3. The fact of the case is that, the informant Rashida Begum, got
married with the accused-appellant Abdus Samad on 11.10.2001, and
started conjugal life with accused-appellant in his house. After some days
of their marriage, her accused-appellant husband, on being instigated by
co-accused Mansur Ali and Manjira Khatun, demanded an amount of Rs.
10,000/- from her to be brought from her elder brother for the purpose
of repairing of his shop-house. Due to her failure to meet such demand,
the accused persons tortured her physically, and also terminated the child
in her womb at Dhubri Civil Hospital without her consent, and
threatening her further that she would not be allowed to give birth to a
child, until the demand is met. They also continued to demand an
amount of Rs. 10,000/-, and simultaneously subjected her to physical
torture. The informant conceived for the second time. The accused
appellant threatened her that they would cause miscarriage of the child in
her womb. Then, she somehow managed to collect Rs. 2,500/- from her
elder brother and gave it to the accused-appellant husband, but they kept
on insisting for the remaining amount of Rs. 7,500/-. She was also told
that she would not be allowed to stay in his house unless she could bring
the amount. The accused appellant administered some tablets to her,
following which, she miscarried. She also sustained injuries due to the
assault on her person by the accused appellant. It is further alleged that
she was administered the tablet to get relief from the injuries she
sustained, but she developed pain after taking the tablet and then she
suffered the miscarriage. On 25.5.2003, she was driven out from the
house of the accused-appellant following her failure to meet the demand

for remaining amount of Rs. 7,500/-. She took refuge in the night at the

Cri. Appeal No. 140 of 2008 Page 2 of 13
house of her brother at Gauripur, and on the next day, she went to her
parental home. She was waiting for the accused to come to take her back
which the accused-appellant did not do. The informant issued legal
notice to her accused-appellant husband to take her back which was not

responded to by the accused appellant.

4) With the above facts, the informant lodged a complaint before the
learned Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Dhubri, who in_ turn,
forwarded the same to the concerned police station, which registered a
case, being No. 138/2003 under Section 498(A) IPC, investigated into it,
and finally, submitted charge-sheet against the accused-appellant under

Section 498(A) IPC.

5) The learned Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Dhubri, tried the
case, and at the stage of judgment, as he found materials against the
accused-appellant under Section 313 IPC also, he committed the case to

the learned court of Sessions Judge, Dhubri.

6) On receipt of the case by the learned Sessions Judge, Dhubri, and
on appearance of the accused-appellant, learned Sessions Judge, framed a
formal charge against him under Sections 313/498(A) IPC, to which he

pleaded innocence.

7) In this case, to bring home the charge against the accused
appellant, the prosecution examined as many as 9 (nine) witnesses
including the Investigating Police Officer. The defence cross-examined the

prosecution witness.

8) In his statement, recorded under Section 313 Cr.PC also, the
accused appellant denied the allegations made against him and also

declined to adduce evidence.

Cri. Appeal No. 140 of 2008 Page 3 of 13
9) In this case, the informant/victim is, examined as PWI1. In her
evidence, she stated that after the marriage, the accused appellant
demanded money from her and also tortured her. She also warned that
if she could not bring money, her pregnancy would be terminated. Due
to her failure to meet the demand, her abortion was caused in the Civil
Hospital at Dhubri without her consent. She was taken to the Dhubri
Civil Hospital forcibly and compelled for termination of her pregnancy.
But, even thereafter, the accused continued to subject her to physical
torture. He also caused miscarriage of her second child in her womb by
administering a tablet which she believed to be a medicine for fever as she
was suffering from fever at that point of time. This time also, the
abortion was done without consent. She proved the FIR, vide Ext.1. In
her cross-examination, as in the FIR, she admitted that she issued a legal
notice to the accused appellant, marked, Ext.A in this case, wherein, as
elicited by the defence through her cross-examination, she did not state
anything about the abortion or her pregnancy and she only alleged
assault on her person by the accused appellant and demanded to take her
back. She is also admitted in her cross-examination that there is a suit,
instituted by the accused appellant, for restitution of conjugal right, vide
TS(R) No. 242/2003, and that she lodged the FIR, after institution of this
suit. She also found to have stated that she did not know the name of the
doctor who performed the abortion in the Dhubri Civil Hospital. She is
further found to have admitted that she did not produce any documents
regarding her pregnancy to the police. She also did not remember the
date when she was taken to Dhubri Civil Hospital, where a lady doctor
caused abortion without her consent. She also found to have admitted
that while adducing evidence, in another case, against the accused
appellant, she did not speak about the assault on her person by the
accused appellant due to her failure to meet the demand for money. She

also deposed that she was driven out of the house of the accused

Cri. Appeal No. 140 of 2008 Page 4 of 13
appellant for her failure to meet the demand for the remaining amount of
Rs.7,500/-. She is also heard saying in her evidence that the accusedappellant refused to agree to the effort of one Jamshed, a village elder,

and her other relatives, to resume their conjugal life.

10) PW/2 is the mother of the victim/PW1, who is found to have stated
in her examination-in-chief that, one day, the accused-appellant and his
father came to her house and asked for Rs.20,000/-/25,000/- from her.
She also found to have stated in her evidence that after the marriage,
both the accused appellant and the informant used to quarrel. PWI1 got
pregnant and the accused appellant told that he did not want any child,
and demanded Rs. 10,000/-, for opening a shop by the accused appellant,
but she gave Rs.2,500/-. She is also found to have deposed that once the
abortion of the child carried by her daughter/PW1, was caused, and
thereafter, miscarriage was caused for the second time while she again
became pregnant. The accused appellant used to scold PW1/victim.
Then, she came back to her parental home and stayed there. The accused
appellant did not take her back. She is also heard saying in her crossexamination that she did not know as to after how many months of their
marriage, the PW1 got pregnant. She also expressed her ignorance about
the second pregnancy of the PW1 in her cross-examination. According to
her, miscarriage of her child was done at the house of the accused
appellant although she was not aware when it happened. She is also
found to have admitted that the accused appellant issued notice for
restitution of conjugal rights. She also admitted that she never saw the
accused appellant assaulting the PW1/victim, with a further admission that
the instant case was filed against the accused appellant after receipt of the

notice from him for restitution of conjugal right.

11) PW3 is the brother-in-law of PW1/victim. According to him, due

to failure to meet the demand for money, the accused appellant assaulted

Cri. Appeal No. 140 of 2008 Page 5 of 13
the PW1, and on 25.5.2003, she was driven out from the house of the
accused appellant. In his cross-examination, he has admitted that he
never saw the accused appellant assaulting the PW1/victim. He has also
admitted that he was not aware of the date and time of demanding

money and also about giving of Rs.2,500/- to the accused appellant.

12) PW4 is the elder brother of the victim/PW1. He claims in his
evidence that on a certain day, PW1 went to their house all of a sudden
and wanted Rs. 10,000/- to meet the demand of the accused appellant to
which he expressed his inability, but his mother gave Rs. 2,500/- to his
sister/PW1. The fact that she would be driven out from the house of the
accused appellant, if the demand is not met, was informed to this witness
by PW1/victim. In his cross-examination, he is found to have admitted
that in another case, he deposed that the PWI1/his sister, came back to
their house and did not return to the house of her husband/accused
appellant, and thereafter, litigations started between them. He also
admitted that he did not state before the police, during investigation, that
the accused appellant demanded Rs. 10,000/- . He further admitted that
he has no personal knowledge about the details of the case filed by

PW/1/victim.

13) PW/5 is also another elder brother of the victim/PW1. He claimed
that as demanded by the accused appellant, they paid him an amount of
Rs. 1,30,000/- after registration of marriage of the accused appellant and
the PW1/victim. The accused appellant further demanded Rs.10,000/- for
his business, but Rs. 2,500/- was given to him. The accused appellant
assaulted the PW for not paying the full amount of Rs. 10,000/- and the
accused appellant forcibly caused her abortion, but, even thereafter, they
continued their conjugal life. Second time also, miscarriage of the child in
womb of the victim/PW1 was caused by the accused appellant. He

expressed his ignorance about the termination of the pregnancy of PW1 at

Cri. Appeal No. 140 of 2008 Page 6 of 13
Dhubri as well as the date on which demand for money was made. He
also admitted that the accused appellant did not demand the money

directly from him. On 25.5.2003, the victim/PW1 went to his house.

14) | PWé6 is the cousin brother of the victim/PW1. According to him,
the PW1/victim has been staying in the house of her parents since last 4
years. The accused-appellant demanded some money out of which, Rs.
2,500/- was paid. He also deposed that the accused appellant had driven
her out from his house for not meeting his demand of money in full. He
also heard about the abortion of the child of the victim/PW1. In his crossexamination, he is found to have stated that the PW1/victim came to her
brother’s house on 10.2.2003, but did not return, and thereafter, the

cases started between the parties.

15)  PW7 is the Senior Medical & Health Officer, Golakganj PHC, is
found to have stated that on 7.7.2003, he examined the victim/PW1,
aged 25 years, with reference to Golakganj PS Case No. 138/2003 under
Section 498(A) IPC, and found no sign of any injury on her person. Ext.2

is the medical report.

16) PW8 is found to have stated in his evidence that after 4/5 months
of conjugal life with the accused appellant, the victim/PW1 left to her
parental house. The accused appellant sent some persons to take her back
although she did not come back. Thereafter, the case was filed by the
accused appellant for restitution of conjugal rights and the victim/PW1
also filed another case. In his cross-examination, he is found to have
stated that the accused appellant neither tortured the victim/PWI1 nor

demanded money from her. Their life was normal.

17)  PW9 is the Investigating Police Officer and he is found to have

stated in his evidence that during investigation, he found nothing

Cri. Appeal No. 140 of 2008 Page 7 of 13
regarding the alleged abortion, and record of such abortion also could

not be traced in the hospital.

18) Substantiating the suggestions of the defence put to the PW2, this
witness (PW9) deposed that PW2 did not state before him that the
accused appellant demanded money. PW5 also did not state before him
as regards the abortion as well as pregnancy of the victim/PW1 to the
police during investigation as well as about the demand of money. It has
come out from the evidence of the Investigating Officer that none of the
witnesses stated before him, during investigation, about the demand of
money, payment of Rs.2,500/- out of the demanded amount of Rs.
10,000/- , and also about the payment of Rs. 1,30,000/-.

19) It also appears from the evidence on record that PW2 i.e. the
mother of the victim/PW1, herself deposed that the victim/PW1 came to
their house and did not return inspite of receipt of legal notice for
restitution of conjugal rights. PW8 categorically stated that after 4/5
months of the marriage, the victim/PW1 went to her parental house and
did not come back inspite of the fact that the accused appellant sent some
persons to bring her back. There is no evidence at all to show that the
PW1 was driven out by the accused appellant from his house after
assaulting her for her failure to meet the demand for money as none of
the witnesses are heard saying that they were informed about the fact of
driving her out by the accused appellant from his house. Unless and until
the other witnesses are told about the assault or other happenings in the
house of the accused appellant by the PW1/victim herself, there was no
scope for any of the witnesses to know about that. None of the
witnesses, stated above, is also found to have stated that they were ever
reported by the victim/PW1 about such facts. On the other hand, they
paid Rs. 1,30,000/- to the accused appellant immediately after registration

of the marriage between them. But the victim, as PW1, herself deposed

Cri. Appeal No. 140 of 2008 Page 8 of 13
that the articles valued about Rs. 1,30,000/-, which she only gave and not
cash amount, thus, belying the evidence of the PW5 on this count. On
the other hand, PW2, i.e. the mother of the victim/PW1, is heard saying
that the accused appellant and his father went to her house and asked for
Rs. 20,000/-/25,000/- which is heard for the first time in this case as this is
not the allegation of the informant/victim PW1 herself. Such allegation is
neither found in the complaint/FIR nor in the evidence of any of the
witnesses except for the first time in the evidence of PW2, even not
corroborated by the victim/PW1, and her sons, PW4 & PW5, is found to
be an attempt to stage a make-belief story by PW2 making herself
untrustworthy. It appears from the evidence of all the witnesses, referred
to above, that none of the witnesses have personal knowledge about the
assault on the person of the victim/PW1, and there is also no evidence, as
stated above, that the victim /PW1 told any of the witnesses that she was
assaulted. That apart, the evidence of PW2 and PW8, taken together,
makes it clearly appear that the victim/PW1 went to her parental house
and stayed there on her own. The evidence of PW1/victim that the
accused appellant did not take her back to his house is belied by the
evidence of PW8, who is an independent witness, that the PW1 refused to
go back to the company of the accused appellant inspite of the fact that

some persons were sent to bring her back to his company.

20) That being so, in view of the discussions of evidence of the
prosecution above, and the findings noted therein, it appears that the
prosecution witnesses belied each other on the demand for property and
as such the ingredients required to establish an offence under Section
498(A)(b) is found missing in this case. Evidently, there is no allegation of
Section 498(A)(b) IPC in the instant case. That apart, the fact as well as
the reason of leaving the house of the accused appellant by the

PW1/victim could be established by the prosecution, and, as such, the

Cri. Appeal No. 140 of 2008 Page 9 of 13
prosecution has not been able to prove the charge against the accused

appellant under Section 498(A) IPC beyond all reasonable doubt.

21) Now, coming to the charge under Section 313 IPC, let us scan the

evidence on record.

22) PW 1/victim, stated in her evidence that first abortion was done in
the Dhubri Civil Hospital by a lady doctor, at the instance of the accused
appellant without, her consent. PW2 is the mother of the victim and she
is found to have stated in her evidence that she was not aware that after
how many months of the marriage the PW1/victim became pregnant and
when her pregnancy was terminated at the Dhubri Civil Hospital. PW1
has admitted in her evidence that no documents regarding her
termination of the pregnancy could be produced before the court. The
investigating officer is also found to have stated in his evidence that no
record of abortion of the pregnancy of the victim/PW1 at the Dhubri Civil
Hospital could be found. The lady doctor, who allegedly terminated the
pregnancy of the victim/PW1, without her consent, is not made an
accused in the case. She also deposed that the accused appellant did not
allow her to give birth to her child until the demand is met. But, even
then, their sexual intercourse continued as she claimed that she became
pregnant for the second time, which was also miscarried, as some tablet
was administered to her by her husband/accused appellant. This fact is
also not known to the mother of the victim/PW1. None of the other
witnesses are found to have stated that they knew as to how and when
both the alleged abortion and miscarriage were caused. There was no
evidence on record to show that none of the witnesses were told by the
victim/PW/1 that her pregnancy was terminated twice by the accused
appellant/doctor without her consent. On the other hand, there is
absolutely no evidence that the accused appellant forcibly took her to the

Dhubri Civil Hospital for abortion. It appears from the evidence, even if

Cri. Appeal No. 140 of 2008 Page 10 of 13
it is believed that she had been to Dhubri Civil Hospital, that the accused
appellant only accompanied her to the hospital. There is no whisper in
her evidence that the accused appellant insisted her to terminate her
pregnancy or made any request to the doctor to cause abortion of the

victim/PW1.

23) Inthe absence of any specific evidence, it cannot be taken to have
been proved by the prosecution that the charge under Section 313 IPC is
proved. That apart, in absence any specific evidence that the doctor at
Dhubri Civil Hospital, aborted her without her consent, it cannot be said
that she has proved the fact of consent or no consent merely because she
made a statement in the evidence without any corroboration. She is even
not found to have made a whisper about the abortion of her first
pregnancy without her consent till after several months of her miscarriage
of the second pregnancy allegedly caused by the accused appellant and till
she filed the present case, after a inordinately long delay of several
months. The conduct of the victim/PW1 rather makes it appear that even
if there was miscarriage of her pregnancy at Dhubri Civil Hospital, yet it
was with her consent. In the absence of implicating evidence, the
accused appellant cannot be held guilty of the charge of causing

miscarriage of her pregnancy without her consent.

24)  Inthis respect, | would like to refer to a decision in Moideenkutty
Haji And Ors. vs Kunhikoya And Ors. reported in A/JR 1987 Ker 184 ,

which to my mind, applicable in the facts and circumstances of the case.

66

be eeeceeeee 5) Section 313, 1P.C. penalises voluntary causing of
miscarriage of a woman with child without her consent while
miscarriage with consent is dealt with under Section 312.
Under Section 313 the person procuring the abortion alone is

liable to punishment whereas under Section 312 the woman Is

Cri. Appeal No. 140 of 2008 Page 11 of 13
also liable for punishment. The only allegation in the
complaint on that side is, on hearing that she is pregnant the
petitioner took her to a Doctor who caused the abortion.
There is no case that it was without her consent. On the other
hand the averments show that she willingly submitted herself
to abortion and even thereafter she had sexual intercourse with
the petitioner. There is nothing to show that abortion was at
his instance. Whether he was only accompanying the lady at
her request and whether he even made a request to the Doctor
to have abortion, are not clear from the allegations. The
Doctor who conducted the abortion is not made an accused
which means she has no complaint against him. It is clear that
an offence under Section 313 is also not made out from the

99

allegations...........

25) The learned trial court is found to have based its judgment on the
evidence in examination-in-chief of the victim/PW1 and her mother/PW2
in respect of the charge under Section 313 IPC although, as discussed
above, the defence could demolish the prosecution case during the crossexamination of the witnesses. The decision of the learned trial court
would have been otherwise had the cross-examination of the prosecution
witnesses been not ignored. On the other hand, the learned trial court
admonished the Investigating Police Officer for not collecting the
evidence relevant for the alleged offence under Section 313 Cr.PC and
even then found the accused appellant guilty of the charge under Section
313 IPC. On the other hand, as indicated above, there is no mention as
well as discussion of the complete evidence on record and no mention at
all of the evidence in cross-examination of the witnesses. The judgment

of learned trial court is found not containing the reasons which formed

Cri. Appeal No. 140 of 2008 Page 12 of 13
the basis of the decisions as is required under Section 354(a)(b) of the

Cr.PC.

26) In view of the above position of law, on the basis of the evidence
on record and the facts narrated above, in the considered view of this
court, the prosecution has failed to bring home the charge under Section

313 IPC.

27) In view of the discussions of the evidence on record, and the
findings recorded during discussions, this court is of the view that the
prosecution has failed to prove the charge against the accused appellant
under Section 498(A) IPC beyond all reasonable doubt, and has failed to
prove the charge under Section 313 IPC at all, and as such, he deserves to
be acquitted.

28) Accordingly, the judgment of the learned trial court of Sessions

Judge, Dhubri, is set aside.
29) The appeal is, accordingly, allowed.

30) Send back the LCR along with a copy of this judgment.

JUDGMENT & ORDER

The instant petition has been preferred, under Section 482 Cr. 3 are the father and mother, respectively, of
the petitioner No. After the complaint was lodged, the learned Court below recorded the
statement of the respondent No. By an order dated
17.02.017, the learned Court below passed an order whereby cognizance of the
offence under Section 406/34 IPC was taken against the petitioners. As said before, the order dated 17.02.2017 and the proceedings in the
CR Case No. Hence, cognizance

ought not to have been taken by the learned Chief J udicial Magistrate, J orhat. Mr. Bora, the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners has placed

reliance on the cases of 7. 359 of 2017 Page 3 of 13
Chennai, (2004) 8 SCC 100, Manish Ratan vs State of M.P, (2007) 1
SCC 262, Bhura Ram vs State of Rajasthan (2008) 11 SCC 103, Sardar
Singh vs State of Haryana (AlR 1977 SC 1766) and Dashrath Rupsingh
Rathod vs State of Maharashtra (2014) 9 SCC 129 in order to support his

contentions. Mr. Sahewalla, further argued
that neither the complaint is barred by limitation nor the learned trial Court
lacks territorial jurisdiction to try the case. |n support
of his case, Mr. Sahewalla, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the
respondent No. 9, There seems to be no dispute on the point that property given to a

Hindu woman at the time of her marriage is termed as Stridhan properties and

Cri. 2, clearly establishes that in the case of
stndhan property, the title of which always remains with the wife though
possession of the same may sometimes be with the husband or other members
of his family, if the husband or any other member of his family commits an
offence of breach of trust with respect to such stridhan they will be liable to
punishment for the offence of criminal breach of trust under Sections 405 and

406 of the IPC. In this regard, when | look into the complaint petition it contains
categorical averments that certain articles were given to the respondent No. 2
at the time of her marriage, which were retained by the petitioners at the time
when the respondent No. The uncontroverted allegations do make out a case of criminal breach of

trust against the petitioners. The Hon’ble Supreme Court, in the facts
of the case, further held that as the status between the parties is not severed
because of the decree of dissolution of marriage the concept of “continuing
offence” gets attracted from the date of deprivation of stridhan, for neither the
husband nor any other family members can have any right over the stridhan

and they remain the custodians. Thus, so long as the stridhan property remains in the hands of accused
persons the offence of criminal breach of trust continues to take place and

fresh period of limitation shall begin to run. There is a
categorical allegation that when the strdhan property was demanded the
petitioners refused to part with it. The veracity of this statement cannot be

gone into in an application under Section 482 CrPC. In the result, the plea of the petitioners that the complaint is barred by
limitation does not stand in view of the law and facts as discussed

hereinbefore. The further ground on which the petitioners have challenged the
proceedings in the learned trial Court arises from the 2005 Amendments to

Section 202 CrPC which now provides as follows;

Section 202. 359 of 2017 Page 7 of 13
Provided that no such airection for investigation shall be made, —

(a) where it aooears to the Magistrate that the offence complained of Is
triable exclusively by the Court of Session; or
(b) where the complaint has not been made by a Court, unless the

complainant and the witnesses present (if any) have been examined on oath
under Section 200. Admittedly, in this case the accused persons are residents of Golaghat
district which is beyond the territorial jurisdiction of Jorhat district. Section
202(1) CrPC, as it stands today, contemplates two circumstances during
inquiry. If the accused persons are residents within the territorial jurisdiction of
the Court then, the Magistrate may postpone the issue of process until all the
witnesses for the complainant is examined. | have already held in the foregoing discussions that the

Cri. Mr. Bora, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners, has relied on the
case of Manish Ratan (supra), wherein the Hon’ble Supreme Court had an
occasion to deal with issue of territorial jurisdiction, Section 177 and Section

178 CrPC to be precise. 2,
while controverting the submissions of Mr. Bora, argued that on the facts of the
case Section 181 (4) of CrPC Is attracted and hence the Court of Chief J udicial

Magistrate, J orhat, has territorial jurisdiction to try case. The main ground taken in the said petition was that the court
at Patiala had no jurisdiction to entertain the complaint since no part of the
cause of action for the same had arisen within its jurisdiction. The application

under Section 482 CrPC, however, stood dismissed. The Supreme Court, in Kushal Kumar Gupta (supra), on the facts of
the case, accepted the arguments put forward by the complainant holding that,
during the trial the accused parents-in-law will have to disprove the
complainant's case that part of the cause of action arose in Patiala where the
dowry articles were to be returned to the complainant and as it stands, the
complaint does indicate that a part of the cause of action arose in Patiala, thus

attracting the provisions of Section 181(4) CrPC. | have perused the complaint petition, and the statement of the
complainant recorded under Section 200 CrPC. These materials though indicate
that stridhan articles were given at Jorhat but there is absence of such
averments that the stridhan articles were to be returned at Jorhat. The legal
notice sent from the complainant also does not contain any statement that

articles are to be returned at J orhat. It may be pointed out here that issue as to territorial jurisdiction has to
be decided on bare perusal of the complaint petition and the material annexed
therewith. As a
consequence of this order, the act of taking of cognizance and order so far as
issuance of processes, including search warrant, are liable to be set aside and
quashed because these orders were passed by a Court having no territorial
jurisdiction to take cognizance and to try the case. 359 of 2017 Page 12 of 13
any agitation on the point of territorial jurisdiction. While parting, | may also add that observations have been made in this
judgment regarding averments in the complaint petition. These observations
are not intended to be prejudicial to the petitioners or for that matter the
respondent No.","IN THE GAUHATI HIGH COURT

JUDGMENT & ORDER

The instant petition has been preferred, under Section 482 Cr.P.C., for
setting aside and quashing the CR Case No. 4/2017, under Sections 406/34 of
the IPC, pending in the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Jorhat, and the
order, dated 17-02-2017, passed therein. The said complaint was lodged by the
respondent No. 2 herein, aS complainant, against the petitioners alleging that
the petitioners have misappropriated her stridhan properties, given at the time
of her marriage with accused petitioner No. 1, Sn Bijay Kumar Jalan. The
petitioner No. 2 and petitioner No. 3 are the father and mother, respectively, of
the petitioner No. 1. The respondent No. 2, had also prayed for issuance of
search warrant for recovery of stridhan articles from the residence of the

petitioners.

2. After the complaint was lodged, the learned Court below recorded the
statement of the respondent No. 2, under Section 200 CrPC. By an order dated
17.02.017, the learned Court below passed an order whereby cognizance of the
offence under Section 406/34 IPC was taken against the petitioners. By the
same order, the learned Court below also issued a search warrant directing the
O/C, Dergaon P.S to execute the search warrant at the house of the
petitioners. The O/C, Dergaon P.S was further directed, by the said order,
dated 17.02.2017, to hand over the stridhan articles to the respondent No. 2

on her executing a bond of Rs 5,00,000/-.

CR Case No. 4/2017 have been put to challenge, by the accused persons as
petitioners, in this petition under Section 482 read with Section 401 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure (CrPC)

4. Heard Mr. A.M. Bora, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners and

Mr. G.N. Sahewalla, learned Senior Counsel for the respondents.

5. Mr. A.M. Bora, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners has assailed

the proceedings in CR 4/2017 on the following aspects;

|. That, the complaint on its reading in entirety does not disclose the

commission of any offence.

li. That, even if the facts stated in the complaint petition are held to be
true then ex facie the complaint is barred by limitation. Hence, cognizance

ought not to have been taken by the learned Chief J udicial Magistrate, J orhat.

lll. That, admittedly, the accused persons are residents of Golaghat district
which is beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the Court of Chief Judicial
Magistrate, Jorhat, therefore, before issuance of process, it was necessary for
the Court to have examined all the witnesses for the complainant as mandated

by Section 202 CrPC

iv. That, on the facts stated in the complaint petition the Court of Chief

J udicial Magistrate, J orhat, lacked territorial jurisdiction to try the case.

6. Mr. Bora, the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners has placed

reliance on the cases of 7. Abraham Ajith vs Inspector of Police,

for the respondent No. 2, while defending the order passed by the learned trial
Court submitted that perusal of the complaint petition shows sufficient
materials that petitioners have misappropriated the stridhan articles given to
the respondent No. 2 at the time of marriage. Mr. Sahewalla, further argued
that neither the complaint is barred by limitation nor the learned trial Court
lacks territorial jurisdiction to try the case. Mr. Sahewalla, however, conceded
that if a mandatory procedure has been violated the case can be remanded to
the learned trial Court for compliance of the procedural irregularity. |n support
of his case, Mr. Sahewalla, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the
respondent No. 2, has relied on the cases reported as Ba/kishan Dhandhania
vs Nidhi Dhandhania, 2016 (2) GLT 100, Nanotech (P) Ltd. vs
Nilkamal Ltd. 2009 (2) GLT 14, Rashmi Kumar vs Mahesh Kumar

Bhada (1997) 2 SCC 397, and Pratibha Rani vs Suraj Kumar (1985) 2

SCC 370.
8. | have paid due consideration to the rival submissions.
9, There seems to be no dispute on the point that property given to a

Hindu woman at the time of her marriage is termed as Stridhan properties and

Cri. Pet. No. 359 of 2017 Page 4 of 13
the case of Pratibha Rani (supra), as relied upon by the learned Senior
Counsel for the respondent No. 2, clearly establishes that in the case of
stndhan property, the title of which always remains with the wife though
possession of the same may sometimes be with the husband or other members
of his family, if the husband or any other member of his family commits an
offence of breach of trust with respect to such stridhan they will be liable to
punishment for the offence of criminal breach of trust under Sections 405 and

406 of the IPC.

10. In this regard, when | look into the complaint petition it contains
categorical averments that certain articles were given to the respondent No. 2
at the time of her marriage, which were retained by the petitioners at the time
when the respondent No. 2 was driven out from the society of the petitioners.
Thus, on perusal of the complaint it cannot be said that ex facie no case of
criminal breach of trust has been made even if the allegations are held to be
true. The uncontroverted allegations do make out a case of criminal breach of

trust against the petitioners.

11. Coming now, to the aspects of limitation as to taking of cognizance,
Mr. Bora, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners, while referring to the
averments made in the complaint petition stated that the complaint has been
filed more than three years after the making of demand and hence the

complaint is barred by limitation.

12. Whether misappropriation of stridhan property is a continuing offence

or not for the purpose of limitation came up for discussion in the case of

Cri. Pet. No. 359 of 2017 Page 5 of 13
Krishna Bhattacharjee v. Sarathi Choudhury, (2016) 2 SCC 705

wherein the Hon’ble Supreme Court posed a question unto itself as follows;

‘32. Regard being had to the aforesaid statement of law, we
have to see whether retention of stridhan by the husband or any

other family members Is a continuing offence or not.”

13. While disposing of the case, the Hon’ble Supreme Court, in Krishna
Bhattacharjee (supra), held that as long as the status of the aggrieved
person remains and stridhan remains in the custody of the husband, the wife
can always put forth her claim under Section 12 of the 2005 Act (Protection of
Women from Domestic Violence Act). The Hon’ble Supreme Court, in the facts
of the case, further held that as the status between the parties is not severed
because of the decree of dissolution of marriage the concept of “continuing
offence” gets attracted from the date of deprivation of stridhan, for neither the
husband nor any other family members can have any right over the stridhan

and they remain the custodians.

14. | may mention here that even though the facts in Krishna
Bhattacharjee (supra), pertained to The Protection of Women from Domestic
Violence Act, 2005, yet the concept of continuing offence as developed in the
case of Krishna Bhattacharjee (Supra), is squarely applicable even for the
offences under the Indian Penal Code as the issue which forms the core of

dispute is misappropriation of stridhan property.

Cri. Pet. No. 359 of 2017 Page 6 of 13
15. In this regard Section 472 of CrPC provides that in the case of a
continuing offence, a fresh period of limitation shall begin to run at every

moment of the time during which the offence continues.

16. Thus, so long as the stridhan property remains in the hands of accused
persons the offence of criminal breach of trust continues to take place and

fresh period of limitation shall begin to run.

17. Now, whether the petitioners have committed criminal breach of trust
with respect to stridhan properties are all questions of fact and no prejudicial
findings can be given by invoking inherent jurisdiction of this Court. There is a
categorical allegation that when the strdhan property was demanded the
petitioners refused to part with it. The veracity of this statement cannot be

gone into in an application under Section 482 CrPC.

18. In the result, the plea of the petitioners that the complaint is barred by
limitation does not stand in view of the law and facts as discussed

hereinbefore.

19. The further ground on which the petitioners have challenged the
proceedings in the learned trial Court arises from the 2005 Amendments to

Section 202 CrPC which now provides as follows;

Section 202. Postponement of issue of process.

1) Any Magistrate, on receipt of a complaint of an offence of which he Is
authorised to take cognizance or which has been made over to him under
Section 192, may, If he thinks fit, and shall, in a case where the accused Is
residing at a place beyond the area in which he exerdses his /urisaiction]
postoone the issue of process against the accused, and either inguire into the
case himself or direct an investigation to be made by a police officer or by such
other person as he thinks fit, for the purpose of deading whether or not there
Is suffiaent ground for proceeding:

Cri. Pet. No. 359 of 2017 Page 7 of 13
Provided that no such airection for investigation shall be made, —

(a) where it aooears to the Magistrate that the offence complained of Is
triable exclusively by the Court of Session; or
(b) where the complaint has not been made by a Court, unless the

complainant and the witnesses present (if any) have been examined on oath
under Section 200.

20. Admittedly, in this case the accused persons are residents of Golaghat
district which is beyond the territorial jurisdiction of Jorhat district. Section
202(1) CrPC, as it stands today, contemplates two circumstances during
inquiry. If the accused persons are residents within the territorial jurisdiction of
the Court then, the Magistrate may postpone the issue of process until all the
witnesses for the complainant is examined. Thus, in these circumstances the
requirement of examining all witnesses before issuance of process is left to the
discretion of the Court. However, this discretion has been taken away if the
accused persons are residents beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the Court. In
these circumstances, the Magistrate has no option but to examine all the
witnesses before issuance of process. Infact, in Ba/kishan Dhandhania
(Supra), this Court, in paragraphs 47, 48, 49 & 50 of the judgment, has held
that Section 202 CrPC is mandatory in nature and its non-compliance will
render the order of issuance of process as illegal. However, having observed
that the mandatory rigours of Section 202 CrPC had not been complied with,
this Court remitted the matter to the learned trial Court for compliance of the
procedure instead of quashing the complaint. | am of the considered view that
Indeed for non- compliance of a mandatory procedure only the order as to
issuance of the process Is vitiated and not the case yer se, if the case otherwise

has merits. | have already held in the foregoing discussions that the

Cri. Pet. No. 359 of 2017 Page 8 of 13
uncontroverted allegations in the complaint has merits and hence the entire
case cannot be quashed on the ground that mandatory procedure as prescribed

In Section 202 CrPC, in the facts of this case, was not complied with.

21. The final leg of the arguments of the petitioners is that the Court of
Chief J udicial Magistrate, J orhat lacked territorial jurisdiction to try the case. In
this regard learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners has relied on the cases of
Y, Abraham Ajith (supra), Bhura Ram, (supra), and Dashrath Rupsingh

Rathod (supra) and Manish Ratan (supra).

22. Mr. Bora, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners, has relied on the
case of Manish Ratan (supra), wherein the Hon’ble Supreme Court had an
occasion to deal with issue of territorial jurisdiction, Section 177 and Section

178 CrPC to be precise.

23. Mr. Sahewalla, the learned Senior Counsel for the respondent No. 2,
while controverting the submissions of Mr. Bora, argued that on the facts of the
case Section 181 (4) of CrPC Is attracted and hence the Court of Chief J udicial

Magistrate, J orhat, has territorial jurisdiction to try case.

24. Section 181 (4) of CRPC provides as follows;

(4) Any offence of criminal misappropriation or of criminal breach of
trust may be inquired into or tned by a Court within whose local
Jurisdiction the offence was committed or any part of the property
Which is the subject of the offence was received or retained, or was
required to be returned or accounted for, by the accused person.

25. In the case of Kushal Kumar Gupta v. Mala Gupta, (2011) 12
SCC 434 the wife had filed a complaint against her parents in law under

Sections 406 and 498-A of the Penal Code, 1860. On being satisfied that a

Cri. Pet. No. 359 of 2017 Page 9 of 13
prima facie case to go to trial had been made out, the learned Magistrate
issued process against the parents-in-law. Aggrieved by the order of issuance
of process, the parents-in-law filed a revision petition which was dismissed.
Thereafter, the parents-in-law filed an application, under Section 482 CrPC, for
quashing of the proceedings arising out of the complaint under Sections 406
and 498-A IPC. The main ground taken in the said petition was that the court
at Patiala had no jurisdiction to entertain the complaint since no part of the
cause of action for the same had arisen within its jurisdiction. The application

under Section 482 CrPC, however, stood dismissed.

26. In the Supreme Court, arguments were made, by the parents-in-law,
with reference to Section 181 (4) of CrPC. It was urged that since no part of
the cause of action had arisen at Patiala, the Court at Patiala did not have
territorial jurisdiction to try the complaint. On the other hand the complainant
argued that since the complaint petition contains a categorical statement that
stridhan articles were to be returned at Patiala Court, Section 181 (4) CrPC gets

attracted, and hence, Court at Patiala had jurisdiction to try the complaint.

27. The Supreme Court, in Kushal Kumar Gupta (supra), on the facts of
the case, accepted the arguments put forward by the complainant holding that,
during the trial the accused parents-in-law will have to disprove the
complainant's case that part of the cause of action arose in Patiala where the
dowry articles were to be returned to the complainant and as it stands, the
complaint does indicate that a part of the cause of action arose in Patiala, thus

attracting the provisions of Section 181(4) CrPC.

Cri. Pet. No. 359 of 2017 Page 10 of 13
28. In the light of the law laid in Kusha/ Kumar Gupta (supra), it needs
to be seen whether in the instant case there is any averment indicating that

any part of the cause of action arose at J orhat.

29. | have perused the complaint petition, and the statement of the
complainant recorded under Section 200 CrPC. These materials though indicate
that stridhan articles were given at Jorhat but there is absence of such
averments that the stridhan articles were to be returned at Jorhat. The legal
notice sent from the complainant also does not contain any statement that

articles are to be returned at J orhat.

30. Hence, in view of the law, as laid down in Kusha/ Kumar Gupta
(Supra), as well as from a reading of Section 181 (4) CrPC, it is clear that the
Court of Chief J udicial Magistrate, J orhat, lacked territorial jurisdiction to try the
case no part of the cause of action, pertaining to alleged criminal breach of
trust of stridhan properties, arose within the jurisdiction of the Court of Chief

J udicial Magistrate, J orhat.

31. It may be pointed out here that issue as to territorial jurisdiction has to
be decided on bare perusal of the complaint petition and the material annexed
therewith. A Magistrate who has already taken cognizance of a case cannot reopen the issue of territorial jurisdiction as is evident from a reading of Section
201 CrPC. The law laid down, in this regard, by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in
the case of Devendra Kishanlal Dagalia v. Dwarkesh Diamonds (P) Ltd.,
(2014) 2 SCC 246, may be referred in this context wherein the Hon'ble

Supreme Court held as follows;

Cri. Pet. No. 359 of 2017 Page 11 of 13
12. Section 201 CrPG as noticed earlier, can be applied
immediately on receipt of a complaint, if the Magistrate is not
competent to take cognizance of the offence Once the
Magistrate taking cognizance of an offence forms his opinion that
there Is suffident ground for proceeding and issues surmmons
under Section 204 CrPC there is no question of going back
following the procedure under Section 201 CrPC: /n absence of
any power of review or recall the order of issuance of summons,
the Magistrate cannot recall the surmmons in exercise of power
under Section 201 CrPC:

32. Since, in the present case, the Court at Jorhat lacks territorial

jurisdiction to try the case, as indicated above, the proper course for the

learned Court below would have been to return the complaint to be presented

before proper Court by exercising jurisdiction under Section 201 CrPC.

33. |, therefore, find that the contention of the learned Senior Counsel for
the petitioners, regarding lack of territorial jurisdiction of Court of Chief J udicial

Magistrate, J orhat, has sufficient force.

34. In the result, and for the foregoing discussions, it is held that no case
for quashing of the complaint is made out on the grounds urged by the
petitioners. The petition is allowed to the extent that Courts at Jorhat do not
possess territorial jurisdiction to try the complaint case in question. As a
consequence of this order, the act of taking of cognizance and order so far as
issuance of processes, including search warrant, are liable to be set aside and
quashed because these orders were passed by a Court having no territorial
jurisdiction to take cognizance and to try the case. On the other hand, it
appears to this Court that the filing of the complaint at Jorhat instead of
Golaghat is the result of choosing a forum at a wrong place and had the

complaint been filed at Golaghat, the case would have been tried there without

Cri. Pet. No. 359 of 2017 Page 12 of 13
any agitation on the point of territorial jurisdiction. In a situation like that in the
Instant case, in the considered view of this Court, Section 201 CrPC can be
usefully applied for the purpose of returning the complaint to be tried by the

appropriate forum of competent jurisdiction.

35. Accordingly, as stated above, the order, dated 17-02-2017, taking
cognizance and issuing process including order of search warrant are set aside
and quashed. On the other hand, for the ends of justice, it is ordered that
complaint be returned by the learned Chief J udicial Magistrate, J orhat, with an
endorsement, as required under Section 201(a) of the Cr.P.C. for presentation

before the proper Court.

36. While parting, | may also add that observations have been made in this
judgment regarding averments in the complaint petition. These observations
are not intended to be prejudicial to the petitioners or for that matter the
respondent No. 2 rather; the observations have been made only to decide the
plea whether inherent jurisdiction of this Court shall be exercised for quashing
the complaint as it does not disclose any cognizable or non-cognizable offence.
Hence, while taking up necessary proceedings with respect to the complaint, in
accordance with the decision rendered in this judgment, the learned Magistrate
Shall not be influenced by any of the observations and will act independently on

the basis of the merit of the case.

Cri. Pet. No. 359 of 2017 Page 1 of 13
JUDGMENT & ORDER

The instant petition has been preferred, under Section 482 Cr.P.C., for
setting aside and quashing the CR Case No. 4/2017, under Sections 406/34 of
the IPC, pending in the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Jorhat, and the
order, dated 17-02-2017, passed therein. The said complaint was lodged by the
respondent No. 2 herein, aS complainant, against the petitioners alleging that
the petitioners have misappropriated her stridhan properties, given at the time
of her marriage with accused petitioner No. 1, Sn Bijay Kumar Jalan. The
petitioner No. 2 and petitioner No. 3 are the father and mother, respectively, of
the petitioner No. 1. The respondent No. 2, had also prayed for issuance of
search warrant for recovery of stridhan articles from the residence of the

petitioners.

2. After the complaint was lodged, the learned Court below recorded the
statement of the respondent No. 2, under Section 200 CrPC. By an order dated
17.02.017, the learned Court below passed an order whereby cognizance of the
offence under Section 406/34 IPC was taken against the petitioners. By the
same order, the learned Court below also issued a search warrant directing the
O/C, Dergaon P.S to execute the search warrant at the house of the
petitioners. The O/C, Dergaon P.S was further directed, by the said order,
dated 17.02.2017, to hand over the stridhan articles to the respondent No. 2

on her executing a bond of Rs 5,00,000/-.

3. As said before, the order dated 17.02.2017 and the proceedings in the
CR Case No. 4/2017 have been put to challenge, by the accused persons as
petitioners, in this petition under Section 482 read with Section 401 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure (CrPC)

4. Heard Mr. A.M. Bora, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners and

Mr. G.N. Sahewalla, learned Senior Counsel for the respondents.

5. Mr. A.M. Bora, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners has assailed

the proceedings in CR 4/2017 on the following aspects;

|. That, the complaint on its reading in entirety does not disclose the

commission of any offence.

li. That, even if the facts stated in the complaint petition are held to be
true then ex facie the complaint is barred by limitation. Hence, cognizance

ought not to have been taken by the learned Chief J udicial Magistrate, J orhat.

lll. That, admittedly, the accused persons are residents of Golaghat district
which is beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the Court of Chief Judicial
Magistrate, Jorhat, therefore, before issuance of process, it was necessary for
the Court to have examined all the witnesses for the complainant as mandated

by Section 202 CrPC

iv. That, on the facts stated in the complaint petition the Court of Chief

J udicial Magistrate, J orhat, lacked territorial jurisdiction to try the case.

6. Mr. Bora, the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners has placed

reliance on the cases of 7. Abraham Ajith vs Inspector of Police,

Singh vs State of Haryana (AlR 1977 SC 1766) and Dashrath Rupsingh
Rathod vs State of Maharashtra (2014) 9 SCC 129 in order to support his

contentions.

7. On the other hand, Mr. Sahewalla, learned Senior Counsel appearing
for the respondent No. 2, while defending the order passed by the learned trial
Court submitted that perusal of the complaint petition shows sufficient
materials that petitioners have misappropriated the stridhan articles given to
the respondent No. 2 at the time of marriage. Mr. Sahewalla, further argued
that neither the complaint is barred by limitation nor the learned trial Court

this regard learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners has relied on the cases of
Y, Abraham Ajith (supra), Bhura Ram, (supra), and Dashrath Rupsingh

Rathod (supra) and Manish Ratan (supra).

22. Mr. Bora, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners, has relied on the
case of Manish Ratan (supra), wherein the Hon’ble Supreme Court had an
occasion to deal with issue of territorial jurisdiction, Section 177 and Section

178 CrPC to be precise.

23. Mr. Sahewalla, the learned Senior Counsel for the respondent No. 2,
while controverting the submissions of Mr. Bora, argued that on the facts of the
case Section 181 (4) of CrPC Is attracted and hence the Court of Chief J udicial

Magistrate, J orhat, has territorial jurisdiction to try case.

24. Section 181 (4) of CRPC provides as follows;

(4) Any offence of criminal misappropriation or of criminal breach of
trust may be inquired into or tned by a Court within whose local
Jurisdiction the offence was committed or any part of the property
Which is the subject of the offence was received or retained, or was
required to be returned or accounted for, by the accused person.

25. In the case of Kushal Kumar Gupta v. Mala Gupta, (2011) 12
SCC 434 the wife had filed a complaint against her parents in law under

Sections 406 and 498-A of the Penal Code, 1860. On being satisfied that a

Cri. Pet. No. 359 of 2017 Page 9 of 13
prima facie case to go to trial had been made out, the learned Magistrate
issued process against the parents-in-law. Aggrieved by the order of issuance
of process, the parents-in-law filed a revision petition which was dismissed.
Thereafter, the parents-in-law filed an application, under Section 482 CrPC, for
quashing of the proceedings arising out of the complaint under Sections 406
and 498-A IPC. The main ground taken in the said petition was that the court
at Patiala had no jurisdiction to entertain the complaint since no part of the
cause of action for the same had arisen within its jurisdiction. The application

under Section 482 CrPC, however, stood dismissed.

26. In the Supreme Court, arguments were made, by the parents-in-law,
with reference to Section 181 (4) of CrPC. It was urged that since no part of
the cause of action had arisen at Patiala, the Court at Patiala did not have
territorial jurisdiction to try the complaint. On the other hand the complainant
argued that since the complaint petition contains a categorical statement that
stridhan articles were to be returned at Patiala Court, Section 181 (4) CrPC gets

attracted, and hence, Court at Patiala had jurisdiction to try the complaint.

27. The Supreme Court, in Kushal Kumar Gupta (supra), on the facts of
the case, accepted the arguments put forward by the complainant holding that,
during the trial the accused parents-in-law will have to disprove the
complainant's case that part of the cause of action arose in Patiala where the
dowry articles were to be returned to the complainant and as it stands, the
complaint does indicate that a part of the cause of action arose in Patiala, thus

attracting the provisions of Section 181(4) CrPC.

Cri. Pet. No. 359 of 2017 Page 10 of 13
28. In the light of the law laid in Kusha/ Kumar Gupta (supra), it needs
to be seen whether in the instant case there is any averment indicating that

any part of the cause of action arose at J orhat.

29. | have perused the complaint petition, and the statement of the
complainant recorded under Section 200 CrPC. These materials though indicate
that stridhan articles were given at Jorhat but there is absence of such
averments that the stridhan articles were to be returned at Jorhat. The legal
notice sent from the complainant also does not contain any statement that

articles are to be returned at J orhat.

30. Hence, in view of the law, as laid down in Kusha/ Kumar Gupta
(Supra), as well as from a reading of Section 181 (4) CrPC, it is clear that the
Court of Chief J udicial Magistrate, J orhat, lacked territorial jurisdiction to try the
case no part of the cause of action, pertaining to alleged criminal breach of
trust of stridhan properties, arose within the jurisdiction of the Court of Chief

J udicial Magistrate, J orhat.

31. It may be pointed out here that issue as to territorial jurisdiction has to
be decided on bare perusal of the complaint petition and the material annexed
therewith. A Magistrate who has already taken cognizance of a case cannot reopen the issue of territorial jurisdiction as is evident from a reading of Section
201 CrPC. The law laid down, in this regard, by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in
the case of Devendra Kishanlal Dagalia v. Dwarkesh Diamonds (P) Ltd.,
(2014) 2 SCC 246, may be referred in this context wherein the Hon'ble

Supreme Court held as follows;

Cri. Pet. No. 359 of 2017 Page 11 of 13
12. Section 201 CrPG as noticed earlier, can be applied
immediately on receipt of a complaint, if the Magistrate is not
competent to take cognizance of the offence Once the
Magistrate taking cognizance of an offence forms his opinion that
there Is suffident ground for proceeding and issues surmmons
under Section 204 CrPC there is no question of going back
following the procedure under Section 201 CrPC: /n absence of
any power of review or recall the order of issuance of summons,
the Magistrate cannot recall the surmmons in exercise of power
under Section 201 CrPC:

32. Since, in the present case, the Court at Jorhat lacks territorial

jurisdiction to try the case, as indicated above, the proper course for the

learned Court below would have been to return the complaint to be presented

before proper Court by exercising jurisdiction under Section 201 CrPC.

33. |, therefore, find that the contention of the learned Senior Counsel for
the petitioners, regarding lack of territorial jurisdiction of Court of Chief J udicial

Magistrate, J orhat, has sufficient force.

34. In the result, and for the foregoing discussions, it is held that no case
for quashing of the complaint is made out on the grounds urged by the
petitioners. The petition is allowed to the extent that Courts at Jorhat do not
possess territorial jurisdiction to try the complaint case in question. As a
consequence of this order, the act of taking of cognizance and order so far as
issuance of processes, including search warrant, are liable to be set aside and
quashed because these orders were passed by a Court having no territorial
jurisdiction to take cognizance and to try the case. On the other hand, it
appears to this Court that the filing of the complaint at Jorhat instead of
Golaghat is the result of choosing a forum at a wrong place and had the

complaint been filed at Golaghat, the case would have been tried there without

Cri. Pet. No. 359 of 2017 Page 12 of 13
any agitation on the point of territorial jurisdiction. In a situation like that in the
Instant case, in the considered view of this Court, Section 201 CrPC can be
usefully applied for the purpose of returning the complaint to be tried by the

appropriate forum of competent jurisdiction.

35. Accordingly, as stated above, the order, dated 17-02-2017, taking
cognizance and issuing process including order of search warrant are set aside
and quashed. On the other hand, for the ends of justice, it is ordered that
complaint be returned by the learned Chief J udicial Magistrate, J orhat, with an
endorsement, as required under Section 201(a) of the Cr.P.C. for presentation

before the proper Court.

36. While parting, | may also add that observations have been made in this
judgment regarding averments in the complaint petition. These observations
are not intended to be prejudicial to the petitioners or for that matter the
respondent No. 2 rather; the observations have been made only to decide the
plea whether inherent jurisdiction of this Court shall be exercised for quashing
the complaint as it does not disclose any cognizable or non-cognizable offence.
Hence, while taking up necessary proceedings with respect to the complaint, in
accordance with the decision rendered in this judgment, the learned Magistrate
Shall not be influenced by any of the observations and will act independently on

the basis of the merit of the case.

JUDGMENT & ORDER (oral)

This revision petition is filed, under Section 397, read with Section
401 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, against the judgment and order
dated 30-11-2007, passed by the learned Additional District and Sessions
Judge (FTC) No. 2, Kamrup, Guwahati, in Criminal Appeal No. 89/2005,
dismissing the criminal appeal and upholding the judgment and order,
dated 26-07-2005, passed by learned Special Railway Magistrate,
Guwahati, in CR Case No. 122°/1999, convicting the accused-petitioner
No. 1, under Section 3 of the Railway Properties (Unlawful Possession)
Act, 1966 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the RPUP Act’) and sentencing him
to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 1 (one) year and to pay a fine of Rs.
5,000/-, in default, to suffer further simple imprisonment for 3 (three)
months. The accused-petitioner Nos. 2 to 12 were sentenced to pay a fine

of Rs. 500/- and in default, simple imprisonment for 1 (one) month each.

Cri. Rev. Pet. No. 35 of 2008 Page 1 of 5
2. | have heard Mr. BM Choudhury, learned counsel appearing on
behalf of accused-petitioners. None appears for the NF Railways. | have
perused the judgments aforesaid as well as the records of the learned trial

Court including the evidence of the witnesses.

3. The prosecution case, in brief, is that the complainant, Sri Bilal
Hussain, ASI of Railway Protection Force/RPAN lodged an FIR alleging,
inter alia, that on 25-10-1999, while he conducted a surprise check at
Rangapara Railway Station Yard, he found a truck bearing registration
No. AR-01-3846 with some CST-9 Pot railway properties along with the
accused-persons. On the basis of such fact, FIR was lodged and after
investigation was made, prosecution report was submitted against the
accused petitioners. The learned Railway Magistrate framed a formal

charge against the accused-petitioners, under Section 3 of the RPUP Act.

4. Now, the question is: Whether the accused-petitioners unlawfully
possessed the Railway properties, i.e. CST-9 Pot and as such committed

offence, under Section 3 of the RPUP Act.

5. To substantiate the accusation, the prosecution examined as many
as 8 witnesses. The defence examined two witnesses. In his statement,
under Section 313 of the Cr.P.C., the accused-petitioners denied the

accusations levelled against them.

6. The complainant, Billal Hussain, was examined as PWI1, who
deposed that on 25-10-1998, he along with some other Railway Police,
went for conducting surprise visit at Rangapara RPF Post, and found a
truck bearing No. AP-01-3846 along with the accused-petitioners, who
were carrying away CST-9 Pot without any valid documents. The truck
was seized along with the materials loaded and accused persons were

arrested and thereafter, he lodged the FIR, vide Ext. 1.

Cri. Rev. Pet. No. 35 of 2008 Page 2 of 5
7. PW2, Keshov Ch. Swargiary, is found to have deposed that the
aforesaid materials were loaded in the truck by the accused-petitioners, on
instructions of accused-petitioner, Raj Kr. Gupta, who was the Contractor.
Since he could not produce any valid documents, the materials were

seized and the accused persons were arrested.

8. PW3, Ganesh Kr. Das, is the person, in whose custody the
aforesaid seized materials were kept by the informant. No evidence is led

by PW/4 against the accused-petitioners.

9. The evidence of PW5 is that the truck was seized with 223

numbers of CST-9 Pot, vide Ext. 2, and he was a witness of the seizure.

10. PW6, Kumud Ch. Das, deposed that the challan was seized vide
Ext. 4.

11. PW/7, Raisuddin Ahmed, is the Investigating Officer, who seized the
materials as already deposed as the accused persons could not produce
any document for procuring the materials from the Railways and for

loading them in the truck.
12. PW8 has not implicated the accused persons.

13. The defence examined two witnesses. The evidence of the defence
is that the materials were loaded in the truck and for that they had valid
document, which the learned trial Court did not believe; therefore, found
taking away of materials by loading in the truck and holding the same to
have been stolen, as such in the unlawful possession of the accusedpetitioners. The evidence on record makes it clear, particularly, the Ext.4,
that there was a challan, issued to the accused-contractor, Raj Kr. Gupta,
to take the materials from the godown for replacement of the slippers of
the Railway track as he got a contract therefor. What this Court notices,
on examination of Ext. 4, is that while the first page of the challan was

filled up with the particular of materials to be lifted, the fourth page

Cri. Rev. Pet. No. 35 of 2008 Page 3 of 5
thereof was left blank to be filled up at a later point of time, although
signature of the competent authority of Railway Department was there
with impression that it will be filled in after lifting of materials from the
godown of the Railways. But it does not necessarily mean that the
accused-contractor did not have the valid authority to lift the materials
from the Railway Department since his contract was for replacement of

slippers of the Railway tracks.

14. It appears from the seizure list that the materials seized were all not
mentioned in the challan and some of the materials were found to have
been lifted without their names being mentioned in the challan.
Therefore, the materials, which were lifted without there being specific

mention in the challan, were lifted without authority.

15. That being so, the accused-petitioner, Raj Kumar Gupta, who lifted
the materials, is found guilty of the offence under Section 3 of the RPUP
Act. So far as the remaining accused-petitioner Nos. 2 to 13 are
concerned, they were all labourers engaged by the accused-petitioner No.
1, contractor, for loading the materials in the truck. They did not commit
theft of the articles and as such it was not in their unlawful possession,
and if at all, it was in the possession of any of the accused-petitioners, it
was Raj Kr. Gupta, at whose instance the materials were lifted for loading
in the truck. Therefore, in the considered view of this Court, the revision

petitioner Nos. 2 to 13 deserve to be acquitted.

16. In the result, the petitioner Nos. 2 to 13 of this petition are

acquitted of the charge levelled against them.

17. So far as the accused-revision petitioner No. 1, Raj Kumar Gupta is
concerned, he has been convicted under Section 3 of the Railway
Properties (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966 and sentenced to suffer

rigorous imprisonment for 1 (one) year and to pay a fine of Rs. 5,000/-,

Cri. Rev. Pet. No. 35 of 2008 Page 4 of 5
in default, to suffer further simple imprisonment for 3 (three) months. In
the considered view of this Court, considering the facts and circumstances
of the case, while upholding the conviction of the accused-revision
petitioner No.1, Raj Kumar Gupta, he is sentenced to pay a fine of Rs.
3,000/-, in default, to suffer further simple imprisonment for 1 (one)

months
18. Accordingly, this revision petition is partly allowed.

This is a criminal revision petition filed under Sections 397/401
read with Section 482 of the Cr. PC, challenging the legality and propriety

of the judgment and order, dated 30.10.2006 passed by the learned Chief

Cri. 155 of 2007 Page I of 10
Judicial Magistrate, Jorhat, in GR Case No. 2,000/-, and in default, to suffer rigorous imprisonment for a further period
of 3 (three) months and also the judgment and order, dated 10.05.2007,
passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Jorhat in Criminal Appeal No. 48/2006, upholding the aforesaid judgment of the learned Chief Judicial

Magistrate, Jorhat. The case for the prosecution is that on 05.02.2005, at about
8:20 pm, informant’s son/injured, Dipankar Kalita went out of the house
after taking dinner. He drove away the cows but the cows damaged the nearby
vegetable shop, which was owned by the accused petitioner. He fell down, and at that time, the accused
petitioner inflicted dao blow on his head causing injuries. While he raised

hue and cry, his parents came out of their house and then took him to

Cri. 155 of 2007 Page 2 of 10
Jorhat Civil Hospital and from there the injured was shifted to Assam

Medical College Hospital, Dibrugarh. On the basis of such facts, the PW3, Smti Kabita Kalita, the
mother of the injured/PW1, lodged the FIR with the Bhogdoi Police Out
Post and on receipt of the FIR through Bhogdoi Police Out Post, the Jorhat
Police Station registered a case, being Case No. The Police, after completion of investigation of the case,
submitted charge-sheet against the accused petitioner under Sections

341/326 of the IPC. That bring home the charge, the prosecution examined as many
as 8 (eight) witnesses, including the Medical Officer and the Investigating

Police Officer. The accused petitioner is also found to have taken the plea, during the

cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses as well as during the defence

Cri. The PW5, PW6 and PW7 are not the eye-witnesses to the
occurrence. The PW5, PW6 and PW7, in their respective evidence, claimed
that they heard about the incident and went to the house of the injured,

PW. So, it appears from the evidence of PW5, PW6 and PW7 that, as
stated above, none of them were eye-witness to the occurrence. He opined that the said
injury was fresh, grievous in nature and was caused by a sharp cutting

object. It is found
from his evidence that he received information about the occurrence over
telephone and on the basis of which he made a General Diary Entry at the
Bhogdoi Police Out Post. 155 of 2007 Page 5 of 10
the father of the injured, makes it appear that he had seen the accused
petitioner and his father and the brother, namely, Sri Sonaram Kalita and

Sri Gathi Kalita fleeing from the place of occurrence. The injured PW1 himself admitted that there was none at the place of
occurrence. His evidence that his parents came out after hearing hue and
cry raised by him was corroborated by his parents, examined as PW2 and

PW3, respectively. No other witnesses were present at the place of occurrence is a
fact, which can also be gathered from the evidence of PW/5, PW/6 and PW/7
to the effect that they came to the house of the injured PW after hearing
about the incident. Their evidence that the PW1 told them about the
incident that the accused petitioner caused injuries to his person is reliable. Such being the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, particularly
the evidence of PW1, PW2 and PW3, it appears that the prosecution has
been able to prove the case against the accused petitioner beyond all
reasonable doubt. But, we have to scan the evidence of the defence

witnesses to find out whether they have been able to discredit the

Cri. Thus, creating reasonable doubt to

absolve the accused petitioner from the charge. DW1, DW2 and DW3 in their evidence claimed that they have
shops at the Tinali near Bahuna College and the accused petitioner also
have a shop there. They kept their shops open till 9:00-9:30pm in the night
everyday, and on the relevant day of occurrence also, they were in their
respective shops till 9:30pm. According to them, at the time of the incident,
the accused petitioner was also in his shop and they went back home

together after closing their shops. It has also come out from the evidence that in their respective
shop, they remain busy. In the instant case, mere

saying by the DWs that the accused petitioner was in his shop at the

Cri. 155 of 2007 Page 7 of 10
relevant time of occurrence, which was about three kilometres away from
the place of occurrence, itself is not sufficient for the reason that in their
evidence itself they have stated that they remained busy in their shops and
there is no evidence that at the relevant point of time they were together
with the accused petitioner. Therefore, such
evidence of the DWs does not appear to be credible and even not found to
be somewhere near to proof the plea of a/ibi, That being so, it appears
that the defence has not been able to discredit or demolish the prosecution

case. As has been found above, the prosecution has been able to prove

the case beyond all reasonable doubt, holding the accused petitioner guilty. 155 of 2007 Page 8 of 10
position, the evidence of the PW1, PW2 and PW3 is relied upon by this

Court for the reasons stated while discussing the evidence. The 2"" leg of argument of the learned counsel for the accused
petitioner is that the injuries sustained by the accused petitioner does not
fall within the category of injuries under Section 326 of the IPC and

according to him, the injuries at best, can be under Section 324 of the IPC. There is apparently
no evidence on record that the victim/PW1 suffered bodily pain for atleast

20 days and was unable to follow his ordinary pursuits. Further, there is no specific
medical evidence on record to suggest that the injured sustained any of the

injuries mentioned in the ‘first’ to ‘eightly’ of Section 320 of the IPC. But, the fact remains that the injuries were caused by a sharp

cutting weapon remain un-assailed. 155 of 2007 Page 9 of 10
this Court, the injuries falls under the categories mentioned under Section

324 of the IPC. Accordingly, the accused petitioner is convicted under Section

324 of the IPC. Considering such facts, this Court is of the considered view that if
the accused petitioner is sentenced to imprisonment for a period already
undergone during investigation and trial and a fine of Rs. 3,000/-, and in default of payment of

fine, to suffer Simple Imprisonment of 15 (fifteen) days.","IN THE GAUHATI HIGH COURT

Magistrate, Jorhat.

2. Heard Mr. Santanu Bora, learned counsel appearing for the
accused petitioner as well as Mr. PS Lahkar, learned Additional Public

Prosecutor, appearing for the State of Assam.

3. The case for the prosecution is that on 05.02.2005, at about
8:20 pm, informant’s son/injured, Dipankar Kalita went out of the house
after taking dinner. There the injured saw some cows entering into their
campus. He drove away the cows but the cows damaged the nearby
vegetable shop, which was owned by the accused petitioner. After the cows
damaged the vegetable shop, Sri Sonaram Kalita and Sri Gathi Kalita, the
father and the brother of the accused petitioner, respectively charged the
injured/PW/1 and assaulted him. He fell down, and at that time, the accused
petitioner inflicted dao blow on his head causing injuries. While he raised

Jorhat Civil Hospital and from there the injured was shifted to Assam

Medical College Hospital, Dibrugarh.

4. On the basis of such facts, the PW3, Smti Kabita Kalita, the
mother of the injured/PW1, lodged the FIR with the Bhogdoi Police Out
Post and on receipt of the FIR through Bhogdoi Police Out Post, the Jorhat
Police Station registered a case, being Case No. 36/2005, under Sections

341/326 of the IPC.

5. The Police, after completion of investigation of the case,
submitted charge-sheet against the accused petitioner under Sections

341/326 of the IPC.

6. The learned Trial Court, framed a formal charge against the
accused petitioner under Sections 341/326 of the IPC, to which he pleaded

innocence.

7. That bring home the charge, the prosecution examined as many
as 8 (eight) witnesses, including the Medical Officer and the Investigating

Police Officer. The defence examined 3 (three) witnesses in rebuttal.

8. In the statement recorded under Section 313 of the Cr.PC, the
accused petitioner is found to have denied the accusation levelled against
him. The accused petitioner is also found to have taken the plea, during the

cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses as well as during the defence

Cri. Rev. P. No. 155 of 2007 Page 3 of 10
evidence, that he was not at the place of occurrence, and as such, he had

taken the plea of a/ibi.

9. In this case, the learned Trial Court in recording the order of
conviction mostly relied upon the evidence of PW1, PW2 and PW53, i.e.,

the injured, his father and his mother, respectively.

10. The PW5, PW6 and PW7 are not the eye-witnesses to the
occurrence. The PW5, PW6 and PW7, in their respective evidence, claimed
that they heard about the incident and went to the house of the injured,

PW.

11. PW5 came to the house of the injured/PW1 in the night on the
date of occurrence itself, after hearing about the incident, and saw that the
injured was bleeding from his head and the PW/2 told him that the accused

petitioner caused him the injuries.

12. P\W/6 also came to the house of the injured, after hearing that the

accused petitioner caused hurt to the injured/PW1.

13. P\/7 also visited the house of the injured/PW1 in the night of the
occurrence itself as he heard halla and he also saw injuries on the head of

the PW1.

14. So, it appears from the evidence of PW5, PW6 and PW7 that, as
stated above, none of them were eye-witness to the occurrence. On visiting

the house of the injured/PW1, they came to know from the PW2, i.e. the

Cri. Rev. P. No. 155 of 2007 Page 4 of 10
father of the injured, that the accused petitioner caused the injuries on the

person of the PW1.

15. PW4 is the Medical Officer, who examined the injured, PW1 in
the Jorhat Civil Hospital, on the date of occurrence itself, on Police
requisition, found one wound on the scalp of PW1. He opined that the said
injury was fresh, grievous in nature and was caused by a sharp cutting

object. He exhibited the report containing his opinion vide Ext.2.

16. PW8 is the Investigating Police Officer of the case. It is found
from his evidence that he received information about the occurrence over
telephone and on the basis of which he made a General Diary Entry at the
Bhogdoi Police Out Post. He investigated the case, prepared the sketch map
of the place of occurrence, vide Ext.3 and also recorded the statement of
the witnesses, including the injured PW1. He also arrested the accused
petitioner. The injured PW1 was shifted from Jorhat Civil Hospital to Assam
Medical College Hospital, Dibrugarh for further treatment, on the next day,

i.e., on 06.02.2005. He received the written FIR, vide Ext.1

17. The evidence of PWI1, in the instant case, appears to be most
vital for the reasons that it has came out from his evidence that at the time
accused petitioner caused injuries to him, there was none at the place of
occurrence. The evidence of PW2 and PW3, the father and the mother,
respectively, of the injured also shows that they appeared at the place of

occurrence, after hearing hue and cry. Further, the evidence of the PW2,

Cri. Rev. P. No. 155 of 2007 Page 5 of 10
the father of the injured, makes it appear that he had seen the accused
petitioner and his father and the brother, namely, Sri Sonaram Kalita and

Sri Gathi Kalita fleeing from the place of occurrence.

18. The occurrence took place in the late evening after 8:00 pm.
The injured PW1 himself admitted that there was none at the place of
occurrence. His evidence that his parents came out after hearing hue and
cry raised by him was corroborated by his parents, examined as PW2 and

PW3, respectively.

19. No other witnesses were present at the place of occurrence is a
fact, which can also be gathered from the evidence of PW/5, PW/6 and PW/7
to the effect that they came to the house of the injured PW after hearing
about the incident. Their evidence that the PW1 told them about the
incident that the accused petitioner caused injuries to his person is reliable.
Such evidence also received support from the evidence of PW2, the father
of the injured that he saw the accused petitioner with his father and the

brother fleeing from the place of occurrence.

20. Such being the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, particularly
the evidence of PW1, PW2 and PW3, it appears that the prosecution has
been able to prove the case against the accused petitioner beyond all
reasonable doubt. But, we have to scan the evidence of the defence

witnesses to find out whether they have been able to discredit the

Cri. Rev. P. No. 155 of 2007 Page 6 of 10
prosecution version of the story. Thus, creating reasonable doubt to

absolve the accused petitioner from the charge.

21. As stated earlier, it is found that the defence has taken the plea
that the accused petitioner was not there at the place of occurrence and
rather he was at his tailoring shop near Bahuna College situated at some

distance away from the place of occurrence.

22. DW1, DW2 and DW3 in their evidence claimed that they have
shops at the Tinali near Bahuna College and the accused petitioner also
have a shop there. They kept their shops open till 9:00-9:30pm in the night
everyday, and on the relevant day of occurrence also, they were in their
respective shops till 9:30pm. According to them, at the time of the incident,
the accused petitioner was also in his shop and they went back home

together after closing their shops.

23. It has also come out from the evidence that in their respective
shop, they remain busy. To substantiate that the accused petitioner was at
his shop, at the relevant point of time, it must be shown by the DWs that
they were with the accused petitioner at the relevant time which fact has

not been brought on record through their evidence.

24. The rule of evidence is that when the plea of a/ib/is taken by the
accused petitioner, then, burden is shifted to him to prove the same and the
burden is rather higher than the prosecution. In the instant case, mere

saying by the DWs that the accused petitioner was in his shop at the

Cri. Rev. P. No. 155 of 2007 Page 7 of 10
relevant time of occurrence, which was about three kilometres away from
the place of occurrence, itself is not sufficient for the reason that in their
evidence itself they have stated that they remained busy in their shops and
there is no evidence that at the relevant point of time they were together
with the accused petitioner. The occurrence took place at about 8:20 pm.
Even if it is supposed that, the accused petitioner was in his tailoring shop at
9:00-9:30 pm, yet the evidence of DWs is bound to prove that at 8:20 pm
or around that time, also he was at his tailoring shop, which is not proved
herein this case, and therefore, the plea of a/ib/ fails. Therefore, such
evidence of the DWs does not appear to be credible and even not found to
be somewhere near to proof the plea of a/ibi, That being so, it appears
that the defence has not been able to discredit or demolish the prosecution

case.

25. As has been found above, the prosecution has been able to prove

the case beyond all reasonable doubt, holding the accused petitioner guilty.

26. Now the question is whether the accused petitioner committed
an offence punishable under Section 326 IPC or under Section 324 of the

IPC.

27. Learned counsel for the accused petitioner has submitted that the
prosecution has not been able to prove the case as there was no

independent witness, which has been discussed above, and inspite of such

Cri. Rev. P. No. 155 of 2007 Page 8 of 10
position, the evidence of the PW1, PW2 and PW3 is relied upon by this

Court for the reasons stated while discussing the evidence.

28. The 2"" leg of argument of the learned counsel for the accused
petitioner is that the injuries sustained by the accused petitioner does not
fall within the category of injuries under Section 326 of the IPC and

according to him, the injuries at best, can be under Section 324 of the IPC.

29. As per the medical report and the evidence of the Doctor, the
accused petitioner caused injuries to the injured PW1 on his scalp with a
sharp cutting object, which was found to be grievous. There is apparently
no evidence on record that the victim/PW1 suffered bodily pain for atleast

20 days and was unable to follow his ordinary pursuits.

30. The injured PW1 was in hospital for four days. There is also no
evidence on record that the injuries sustained by the PW1/injured was of
such nature or degree to endanger his life. Further, there is no specific
medical evidence on record to suggest that the injured sustained any of the

injuries mentioned in the ‘first’ to ‘eightly’ of Section 320 of the IPC.

31. That being so, in the instant case, the injury does not appear to
be an injury falling under ‘first’ to ‘eightly’ mentioned in Section 320 of the

IPC, punishable under Section 326 of the IPC.

32. But, the fact remains that the injuries were caused by a sharp

cutting weapon remain un-assailed. Therefore, in the considered view of

Cri. Rev. P. No. 155 of 2007 Page 9 of 10
this Court, the injuries falls under the categories mentioned under Section

324 of the IPC.

33. Accordingly, the accused petitioner is convicted under Section

324 of the IPC.

34. This Court has also noticed that the case is of the year 2005 and
after fighting a long drawn legal battle in the Trial Court and in the
Appellate Court of the learned Sessions Judge, since 2005 the accused

petitioner has approached this Court.

35. Considering such facts, this Court is of the considered view that if
the accused petitioner is sentenced to imprisonment for a period already
undergone during investigation and trial and a fine of Rs. 3,000/-, and in
default, Simple Imprisonment for 15 (fifteen) days will meet the ends of

justice.

36. Accordingly, the accused petitioner is sentenced to the period
already undergone, and a fine of Rs. 3,000/-, and in default of payment of

fine, to suffer Simple Imprisonment of 15 (fifteen) days.

37. The revision petition is partly allowed.

38. Send down the LCR along with the copy of this judgment.

read with Section 482 of the Cr.PC, challenging the legality and propriety

of the judgment and order, dated 30.10.2006 passed by the learned Chief

passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Jorhat in Criminal Appeal No.
48/2006, upholding the aforesaid judgment of the learned Chief Judicial

Magistrate, Jorhat.

2. Heard Mr. Santanu Bora, learned counsel appearing for the
accused petitioner as well as Mr. PS Lahkar, learned Additional Public

Prosecutor, appearing for the State of Assam.

3. The case for the prosecution is that on 05.02.2005, at about
8:20 pm, informant’s son/injured, Dipankar Kalita went out of the house
after taking dinner. There the injured saw some cows entering into their
campus. He drove away the cows but the cows damaged the nearby
vegetable shop, which was owned by the accused petitioner. After the cows
damaged the vegetable shop, Sri Sonaram Kalita and Sri Gathi Kalita, the
father and the brother of the accused petitioner, respectively charged the
injured/PW/1 and assaulted him. He fell down, and at that time, the accused
petitioner inflicted dao blow on his head causing injuries. While he raised

Cri. Rev. P. No. 155 of 2007 Page 2 of 10
Jorhat Civil Hospital and from there the injured was shifted to Assam

Medical College Hospital, Dibrugarh.

4. On the basis of such facts, the PW3, Smti Kabita Kalita, the
mother of the injured/PW1, lodged the FIR with the Bhogdoi Police Out
Post and on receipt of the FIR through Bhogdoi Police Out Post, the Jorhat
Police Station registered a case, being Case No. 36/2005, under Sections

341/326 of the IPC.

5. The Police, after completion of investigation of the case,
submitted charge-sheet against the accused petitioner under Sections

341/326 of the IPC.

6. The learned Trial Court, framed a formal charge against the
accused petitioner under Sections 341/326 of the IPC, to which he pleaded

innocence.

7. That bring home the charge, the prosecution examined as many
as 8 (eight) witnesses, including the Medical Officer and the Investigating

Police Officer. The defence examined 3 (three) witnesses in rebuttal.

8. In the statement recorded under Section 313 of the Cr.PC, the
accused petitioner is found to have denied the accusation levelled against
him. The accused petitioner is also found to have taken the plea, during the

cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses as well as during the defence

Cri. Rev. P. No. 155 of 2007 Page 3 of 10
evidence, that he was not at the place of occurrence, and as such, he had

taken the plea of a/ibi.

9. In this case, the learned Trial Court in recording the order of
conviction mostly relied upon the evidence of PW1, PW2 and PW53, i.e.,

the injured, his father and his mother, respectively.

10. The PW5, PW6 and PW7 are not the eye-witnesses to the
occurrence. The PW5, PW6 and PW7, in their respective evidence, claimed
that they heard about the incident and went to the house of the injured,

PW.

11. PW5 came to the house of the injured/PW1 in the night on the
date of occurrence itself, after hearing about the incident, and saw that the
injured was bleeding from his head and the PW/2 told him that the accused

petitioner caused him the injuries.

12. P\W/6 also came to the house of the injured, after hearing that the

accused petitioner caused hurt to the injured/PW1.

13. P\/7 also visited the house of the injured/PW1 in the night of the
occurrence itself as he heard halla and he also saw injuries on the head of

the PW1.

14. So, it appears from the evidence of PW5, PW6 and PW7 that, as
stated above, none of them were eye-witness to the occurrence. On visiting

the house of the injured/PW1, they came to know from the PW2, i.e. the

Cri. Rev. P. No. 155 of 2007 Page 4 of 10
father of the injured, that the accused petitioner caused the injuries on the

person of the PW1.

15. PW4 is the Medical Officer, who examined the injured, PW1 in
the Jorhat Civil Hospital, on the date of occurrence itself, on Police
requisition, found one wound on the scalp of PW1. He opined that the said
injury was fresh, grievous in nature and was caused by a sharp cutting

object. He exhibited the report containing his opinion vide Ext.2.

16. PW8 is the Investigating Police Officer of the case. It is found
from his evidence that he received information about the occurrence over
telephone and on the basis of which he made a General Diary Entry at the
Bhogdoi Police Out Post. He investigated the case, prepared the sketch map
of the place of occurrence, vide Ext.3 and also recorded the statement of
the witnesses, including the injured PW1. He also arrested the accused
petitioner. The injured PW1 was shifted from Jorhat Civil Hospital to Assam
Medical College Hospital, Dibrugarh for further treatment, on the next day,

i.e., on 06.02.2005. He received the written FIR, vide Ext.1

17. The evidence of PWI1, in the instant case, appears to be most

the father of the injured, makes it appear that he had seen the accused
petitioner and his father and the brother, namely, Sri Sonaram Kalita and

Sri Gathi Kalita fleeing from the place of occurrence.

18. The occurrence took place in the late evening after 8:00 pm.
The injured PW1 himself admitted that there was none at the place of
occurrence. His evidence that his parents came out after hearing hue and
cry raised by him was corroborated by his parents, examined as PW2 and

PW3, respectively.

19. No other witnesses were present at the place of occurrence is a

17. The evidence of PWI1, in the instant case, appears to be most
vital for the reasons that it has came out from his evidence that at the time
accused petitioner caused injuries to him, there was none at the place of
occurrence. The evidence of PW2 and PW3, the father and the mother,
respectively, of the injured also shows that they appeared at the place of

occurrence, after hearing hue and cry. Further, the evidence of the PW2,

Cri. Rev. P. No. 155 of 2007 Page 5 of 10
the father of the injured, makes it appear that he had seen the accused
petitioner and his father and the brother, namely, Sri Sonaram Kalita and

Sri Gathi Kalita fleeing from the place of occurrence.

18. The occurrence took place in the late evening after 8:00 pm.
The injured PW1 himself admitted that there was none at the place of
occurrence. His evidence that his parents came out after hearing hue and
cry raised by him was corroborated by his parents, examined as PW2 and

PW3, respectively.

19. No other witnesses were present at the place of occurrence is a
fact, which can also be gathered from the evidence of PW/5, PW/6 and PW/7
to the effect that they came to the house of the injured PW after hearing
about the incident. Their evidence that the PW1 told them about the
incident that the accused petitioner caused injuries to his person is reliable.
Such evidence also received support from the evidence of PW2, the father
of the injured that he saw the accused petitioner with his father and the

brother fleeing from the place of occurrence.

20. Such being the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, particularly
the evidence of PW1, PW2 and PW3, it appears that the prosecution has
been able to prove the case against the accused petitioner beyond all
reasonable doubt. But, we have to scan the evidence of the defence

witnesses to find out whether they have been able to discredit the

Cri. Rev. P. No. 155 of 2007 Page 6 of 10
prosecution version of the story. Thus, creating reasonable doubt to

absolve the accused petitioner from the charge.

21. As stated earlier, it is found that the defence has taken the plea
that the accused petitioner was not there at the place of occurrence and
rather he was at his tailoring shop near Bahuna College situated at some

distance away from the place of occurrence.

22. DW1, DW2 and DW3 in their evidence claimed that they have
shops at the Tinali near Bahuna College and the accused petitioner also
have a shop there. They kept their shops open till 9:00-9:30pm in the night
everyday, and on the relevant day of occurrence also, they were in their
respective shops till 9:30pm. According to them, at the time of the incident,
the accused petitioner was also in his shop and they went back home

together after closing their shops.

23. It has also come out from the evidence that in their respective
shop, they remain busy. To substantiate that the accused petitioner was at
his shop, at the relevant point of time, it must be shown by the DWs that
they were with the accused petitioner at the relevant time which fact has

not been brought on record through their evidence.

24. The rule of evidence is that when the plea of a/ib/is taken by the
accused petitioner, then, burden is shifted to him to prove the same and the
burden is rather higher than the prosecution. In the instant case, mere

saying by the DWs that the accused petitioner was in his shop at the

Cri. Rev. P. No. 155 of 2007 Page 7 of 10
relevant time of occurrence, which was about three kilometres away from
the place of occurrence, itself is not sufficient for the reason that in their
evidence itself they have stated that they remained busy in their shops and
there is no evidence that at the relevant point of time they were together
with the accused petitioner. The occurrence took place at about 8:20 pm.
Even if it is supposed that, the accused petitioner was in his tailoring shop at
9:00-9:30 pm, yet the evidence of DWs is bound to prove that at 8:20 pm
or around that time, also he was at his tailoring shop, which is not proved
herein this case, and therefore, the plea of a/ib/ fails. Therefore, such
evidence of the DWs does not appear to be credible and even not found to
be somewhere near to proof the plea of a/ibi, That being so, it appears
that the defence has not been able to discredit or demolish the prosecution

case.

25. As has been found above, the prosecution has been able to prove

the case beyond all reasonable doubt, holding the accused petitioner guilty.

26. Now the question is whether the accused petitioner committed
an offence punishable under Section 326 IPC or under Section 324 of the

IPC.

27. Learned counsel for the accused petitioner has submitted that the
prosecution has not been able to prove the case as there was no

independent witness, which has been discussed above, and inspite of such

Cri. Rev. P. No. 155 of 2007 Page 8 of 10
position, the evidence of the PW1, PW2 and PW3 is relied upon by this

Court for the reasons stated while discussing the evidence.

28. The 2"" leg of argument of the learned counsel for the accused
petitioner is that the injuries sustained by the accused petitioner does not
fall within the category of injuries under Section 326 of the IPC and

according to him, the injuries at best, can be under Section 324 of the IPC.

29. As per the medical report and the evidence of the Doctor, the
accused petitioner caused injuries to the injured PW1 on his scalp with a
sharp cutting object, which was found to be grievous. There is apparently
no evidence on record that the victim/PW1 suffered bodily pain for atleast

20 days and was unable to follow his ordinary pursuits.

30. The injured PW1 was in hospital for four days. There is also no
evidence on record that the injuries sustained by the PW1/injured was of
such nature or degree to endanger his life. Further, there is no specific
medical evidence on record to suggest that the injured sustained any of the

injuries mentioned in the ‘first’ to ‘eightly’ of Section 320 of the IPC.

31. That being so, in the instant case, the injury does not appear to
be an injury falling under ‘first’ to ‘eightly’ mentioned in Section 320 of the

IPC, punishable under Section 326 of the IPC.

32. But, the fact remains that the injuries were caused by a sharp

cutting weapon remain un-assailed. Therefore, in the considered view of

Cri. Rev. P. No. 155 of 2007 Page 9 of 10
this Court, the injuries falls under the categories mentioned under Section

324 of the IPC.

33. Accordingly, the accused petitioner is convicted under Section

324 of the IPC.

34. This Court has also noticed that the case is of the year 2005 and
after fighting a long drawn legal battle in the Trial Court and in the
Appellate Court of the learned Sessions Judge, since 2005 the accused

petitioner has approached this Court.

35. Considering such facts, this Court is of the considered view that if
the accused petitioner is sentenced to imprisonment for a period already
undergone during investigation and trial and a fine of Rs. 3,000/-, and in
default, Simple Imprisonment for 15 (fifteen) days will meet the ends of

justice.

36. Accordingly, the accused petitioner is sentenced to the period
already undergone, and a fine of Rs. 3,000/-, and in default of payment of

fine, to suffer Simple Imprisonment of 15 (fifteen) days.

37. The revision petition is partly allowed.

38. Send down the LCR along with the copy of this judgment.

Date of hearing :27* of July, 2017. 192/2016 preferred under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. [2] It may be mentioned at the outset that both these cases were
heard and reserved for verdict. [3] The amendments, sought to be introduced in Criminal Petition
No. [4] The amendments, sought for, can be precisely stated as follows:

L. The Case No. in the original application was mentioned as CR

854/2016 which has been amended as GR 854/2016

ii. Accordingly, the firm had lifted 70,413 metric tonnes of coal from
NEC, CIL but instead of transporting the said coal to Meghalaya Cements Ltd the
Director diverted the said coal for use in M/s K.D. Coke, Jorabat. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 4 of 26
[8] As against the Closure Report, under Section 173 CrPC, the
impugned order, dated 4.8.12, was passed by learned Special Judge, Assam,
Guwahati, holding that since many aspects were left out during investigation the
Closure report cannot be accepted, and thereafter, the learned Special Judge
ordered re-investigation to be conducted by S$.P, CBI/ACB and to entrust a
competent officer other than Mr. R.C. Basumatary, to investigate the case and

submit report in final form. [9] In the investigation that ensued thereafter, the impugned
chargesheet, Annexure 4, was laid against the petitioners in both the cases. [13] The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners has placed reliance
on the cases of Vinay Tyagi v. Irshad Ali, reported in (2013) 5 SCC 762, Anju
Chaudhary v. State of U.P., reported in (2013) 6 SCC 384, Rama Chaudhary v.
State of Bihar, reported in (2009) 6 SCC 346, Chandra Babu v. State, reported in
(2015) 8 SCC 774, and State of Orissa v. Mahima, reported in (2007) 15 SCC

580. As
against the order of the Orissa High Court, the State preferred an appeal. In the
context of the factual scenario, the Hon’ble Supreme Court re-iterated the law
laid down in Hemant Dhasmana vs CBI, reported in (2001) 7 SCC 536 holding
that power of police to conduct further investigation in terms of Section 173 (8)

Cr. [15] In Rama Chaudhary (supra), the police after investigation had laid
a charge sheet against the accused persons. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 6 of 26
Investigating Agency had mentioned the name of 8 new witnesses. The prayer of
the prosecution to examine those witnesses was allowed by the Sessions Judge. Aggrieved by the order of Sessions Judge, the accused preferred a Criminal
Revision before the Hon’ble High Court of Patna. The material collected in further investigation

cannot be rejected only because it has been filed at the stage of the trial. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 7 of 26
(i) Whether in exercise of its powers under Section 173 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short “the Code”), the trial court
has the jurisdiction to ignore any one of the reports, where there are
two reports by the same or different investigating agencies in

furtherance of the orders of a court? [19] The “initial investigation” is the one which the empowered police
officer shall conduct in furtherance of registration of an FIR. It is
the continuation of previous investigation, and therefore, is understood and
described as “further investigation”. This is a kind of continuation of the previous investigation. The basis is
discovery of fresh evidence and in continuation of the same offence and chain of
events relating to the same occurrence incidental thereto. In other words, it has
to be understood in complete contradistinction to a “reinvestigation”, “fresh” or

“de novo” investigation. [21] However, in the case of a “fresh investigation”, “reinvestigation”
or “de novo investigation” there has to be a definite order of the court. The
order of the court unambiguously should state as to whether the previous
investigation, for reasons to be recorded, is incapable of being acted upon. Neither the investigating agency nor the Magistrate has any power to order or
conduct “fresh investigation”. This is primarily for the reason that it would be

opposed to the scheme of the Code. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 9 of 26
“fresh”/“de novo” investigation passed by the higher judiciary should always be
coupled with a specific direction as to the fate of the investigation already
conducted. The cases where such direction can be issued are few and far
between. This principle flows from the constitutional
mandate contained in Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution of India. The Supreme Court
eventually held that under the Code of Criminal Procedure a Magistrate has

power to order further investigation but not reinvestigation. [23] In view of the cases relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel, |
believe, it is not in dispute that once the Magistrate receives a report under
Section 173 CrPC on completion of investigation, ordering further investigation

is one of the courses open to the Magistrate. [24] | may recall here the case of Abhinandan Jha v. Dinesh Mishra,
reported in (AIR 1968 SC 117) wherein the Supreme Court had the occasion to

deal with the question as to what is the position, when the Magistrate is dealing

Criminal Petition No. That is, if the Magistrate feels,
after considering the final report, that the investigation is unsatisfactory, or
incomplete, or that there is scope for further investigation, it will be open to the
Magistrate to decline to accept the final report and direct the police to make
further investigation, under Section 156(3). The police, after such further
investigation, may submit a charge-sheet, or, again submit a final report,
depending upon the further investigation made by them. It may be that in a given situation a superior court in
exercise of its constitutional power, namely, under Articles 226 and 32 of the
Constitution of India could direct a “State” to get an offence investigated and/or
further investigated by a different agency. A distinction, therefore, exists between a reinvestigation and further

investigation. The meaning of “further” is additional, more, or supplemental. “Further” investigation, therefore, is the continuation of the earlier
investigation and not a fresh investigation or reinvestigation to be

started ab initio wiping out the earlier investigation altogether. Direction of a reinvestigation, however, being forbidden in law, no
superior court would ordinarily issue such a direction. Once such further investigation is ordered a
fresh investigation can be conducted and a new report can be filed and there
appears no hindrance in law that new opinion cannot be given. [31] In the present case so far as the order of the learned Special Judge
is concerned he had ordered a re-investigation by the CBI and by a different
Officer. But, the question which needs to be determined

here is whether by the impugned order a re-investigation has been conducted? [33] The first test of re-investigation is that a fresh investigation
should, ordinarily, be conducted by an agency other than the one which has
already conducted investigation. The second aspect of re-investigation is

observation regarding previous mala fide investigation. [35] Thus, the order of the learned Special Judge, cannot be assailed

on this ground. When the matter was
challenged in Hon’ble Supreme Court, by Iridium India, one of the grounds
taken by them was that the respondent Company cannot hide behind the
defence that the Company is incapable of possessing the necessary mens rea for
commission of the offence of cheating. The criminal liability of a corporation would arise when an offence is
committed in relation to the business of the corporation by a person or body of
persons in control of its affairs. Mens rea is attributed to corporations on the principle of

“alter ego” of the company. supra), is

reproduced as follows;

[38]

63... it becomes evident that a corporation is virtually in the
same position as any individual and may be convicted of
common law as well as statutory offences including those
requiring mens rea. In such circumstances, it would be necessary to ascertain
that the degree and control of the person or body of persons is so
intense that a corporation may be said to think and act through
the person or the body of persons. The position of law on this
issue in Canada is almost the same. However, when the matter was taken up for the cognizance, the Special
Judge held that Mr Sunil Bharti Mittal was Chairman-cum-Managing Director of
Bharti Cellular Ltd., Mr. Asim Ghosh was Managing Director of Hutchison Max
Telecom (P) Ltd. and Mr Ravi Ruia was a Director in Sterling Cellular Ltd., who
used to chair the meetings of its Board. According to him, in that capacity, these
persons, prima facie, could be treated as controlling the affairs of the respective
companies and represent the directing mind and will of each company. [41] On the facts of the case in Sunil Bharti Mittal (supra) itself it can
be said that this case may not be of any assistance to decide the present subject
matter as it is not the case of the petitioners that without they being named in
the charge sheet, processes have been issued against them without recording a
prima facie observation regarding their liability. If and when a é statute
contemplates creation of such a legal fiction, it provides specifically therefor. In
absence of any provision laid down under the statute, a Director of a Company
Or an employee cannot be held to be vicariously liable for any offence

committed by the Company itself. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 19 of 26
accused its Managing Director was impleaded as accused on the principles of
vicarious liability. [47] It now needs to be seen as to what is the nature of allegations

against the petitioners. 192/2016 are

the Directors of Meghalaya Cements Ltd, a company registered under the

Criminal Petition No. 189/2016
is the Chairman of said Meghalaya Cements Ltd. On a reading of the
chargesheet, dated 27.3.2014, appended as Annexure 4 to this petition, the
allegation against the petitioners is that during the period of 2008-2011 some
officials of North Eastern Coal Fields, CIL, entered into criminal conspiracy with
Sri Kailash Chand Lohia, Director of Meghalaya Cements Ltd. to facilitate misuse
of coal supplied from NEC, CIL under subsidized rates as per National Coal
Distribution Policy of Govt. As per the Fuel Supply Agreement, done
between NEC/CIL and Sri Kailash Chand Lohia for Meghalaya Cements Ltd, coal
to the tune of 38,000 metric tonnes per annum was allotted to the Unit. The coal was allotted
and lifted at the rate of Rs 3680/- per tonne and rate fixed under E-auction
wasRs 3851/-. The quantity of coal lifted by Meghalaya Cements Ltd would have
fetched an amount of Rs 15,50,25,136/- to the CIL it sold through e-auction

open market. [49] As against the heading “Charge” in Annexure 4, an elaborate
factual allegations have been portrayed. Though there are enough incriminating
circumstances as to how the coal obtained at subsidized rate was misused for
purpose other than the purpose meant for Meghalaya Cements Ltd. it would be
sufficient for the purpose of present adjudication if some sets of allegations are

brought on record. The
Commissioner of Taxes in his communications to CBI informed that a total of
295 numbers of truck had crossed the Taxation Check Gate. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 22 of 26
Supreme Court when a complaint/FIR can be quashed. Those circumstances are

as follows:

(i) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the
complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in
their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a

case against the accused. (ii) Where the allegations in the first information report and other
materials, if any, accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable
offence, justifying an investigation by police officers under Section
156(1) of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the

purview of Section 155(2) of the Code. (vii) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala
fide and/or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an
ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a

view to spite him due to private and personal grudge. [54] There is yet another aspect on which arguments have been
advanced and which needs appreciation. It is the contention of petitioners,
particularly in Criminal Petition No. However, on perusal of charge sheet, Annexure 4, it is
found that petitioner No. 4, as Senior Manager (Stores), created false records of
receipt of coal consignments. | believe, embarking into any kind of inquiry to
ascertain the truthfulness of such allegations, at this stage, would be highly

prejudicial to the prosecution case. [56] In Director of Public Prosecutions v. Kent and Sussex Contractors
Lid. reported in (1957) 1 QB 159 summarized his findings in the following

words:

A company may in many ways be likened to a human body. They have a
brain and a nerve centre which controls what they do. They also have
hands which hold the tools and act in accordance with directions from
the centre. Others are directors and managers
who represent the directing mind and will of the company, and control
what they do. The state of mind of these managers is the state of mind of
the company and Is treated by the law as such. That is made clear in Lord Haldane’s speech in Lennard’s Carrying Co.

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 25 of 26
Ltd. v. Asiatic Petroleurn Co. Ltd. So also in the criminal law, in cases
where the law requires a guilty mind as a condition of a criminal offence,
the guilty mind of the directors or the managers will render the company

themselves guilty. PC because of the nature of materials unearthed during investigation. It
would, thus, not be proper to invoke the jurisdiction vested in this Court under
Section 482 Cr.","IN THE GAUHATI HIGH COURT

JUDGMENT & ORDER (CAV)

By way of this common judgment and order, | propose to
dispose of the Criminal Petition No. 189/2016 and Criminal Petition No.

192/2016 preferred under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

[2] It may be mentioned at the outset that both these cases were
heard and reserved for verdict. However, certain discrepancy was noticed in the
nomenclature of the case, sought to be quashed, hence the discrepancy was

brought to the notice of learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners. The learned

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 2 of 26
Senior Counsel for the petitioners, having realized the error, sought to file a
correction/modification application and accordingly vide |.A (Crl) No. 603/2017
in Criminal Petition No. 189/2016 and 1.A (Crl) No. 608/2017 in Criminal

Petition No. 192/2016 amendments were sought to be introduced.

[3] The amendments, sought to be introduced in Criminal Petition
No. 189/2016 and Criminal Petition No. 192/2016, were heard on 24.08.2017
and after considering that the proposed amendments are only clarificatory in
nature, prayers in both the Interlocutory Applications were allowed. The
amendments in Criminal Petition No. 189/2016 and Criminal Petition No.

192/2016 shall now be read as part of original petitions.

[4] The amendments, sought for, can be precisely stated as follows:

L. The Case No. in the original application was mentioned as CR

854/2016 which has been amended as GR 854/2016

ii. In the cause title as well as in the body of the petition it was
stated that the case is presently pending in the Court of learned
Chief Judicial Magistrate, Kamrup (Metro), Guwahati which
has, now, been corrected as learned Special Judicial Magistrate,

Assam, Guwahati

[5] Having dealt with the clarificatory aspects of the case | now

proceed to decide the case as follows;

[6] The petitioners 1, 2 and 3 in Criminal Petition No. 192/2016 are
the Directors of Meghalaya Cements Ltd, a company registered under the
Companies Act, 1956 and the petitioner No. 4 is an employee of the said

Company. On the other hand, the petitioner in Criminal Petition No. 189/2016

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 3 of 26
is the Chairman of said Meghalaya Cements Ltd. On a reading of the chargesheet
dated 27.3.2014, appended as Annexure 4 to this petition, the allegation against
the petitioners is that during the period of 2008-2011 some officials of North
Eastern Coal Fields, CIL, (hereinafter referred to NEC, CIL) entered into criminal
conspiracy with Sri Kailash Chand Lohia, Director of Meghalaya Cements Ltd. to
facilitate misuse of coal supplied from NEC, CIL under subsidized rates as per
National Coal Distribution Policy of Govt. of India. As per the Fuel Supply
Agreement done between NEC/CIL and Sri Kailash Chand Lohia for Meghalaya
Cements Ltd, coal to the tune of 38,000 metric tonnes per annum was allotted
to the Unit. Accordingly, the firm had lifted 70,413 metric tonnes of coal from
NEC, CIL but instead of transporting the said coal to Meghalaya Cements Ltd the
Director diverted the said coal for use in M/s K.D. Coke, Jorabat. The coal was
allotted and lifted at the rate of Rs 3680/- per tonne and rate fixed under Eauction is Rs 3851. The quantity of coal lifted by Meghalaya Cements Ltd would
have fetched an amount of Rs 15,50,25,136/- to the CIL if sold through e-auction
open market. Hence, wrongful loss was caused to CIL. Apart from the
allegations of cheating there are some other allegations that the petitioners
having entered into conspiracy created forged documents and used those
documents for the purpose of cheating. A chargesheet, thus, for the offences
under Section 420/468 read with Section 120B IPC has been laid against the

petitioners in both the cases.

[7] An FIR was lodged in this regard by Mr. H.C. Nath, IPS, Head of
Branch, CBI/ACB/Guwahati on 12.4.2011. The FIR was investigated, and after

investigation, a closure report, under Section 173 CrPC, was laid on 27.6.2012.

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 4 of 26
[8] As against the Closure Report, under Section 173 CrPC, the
impugned order, dated 4.8.12, was passed by learned Special Judge, Assam,
Guwahati, holding that since many aspects were left out during investigation the
Closure report cannot be accepted, and thereafter, the learned Special Judge
ordered re-investigation to be conducted by S$.P, CBI/ACB and to entrust a
competent officer other than Mr. R.C. Basumatary, to investigate the case and

submit report in final form.

[9] In the investigation that ensued thereafter, the impugned
chargesheet, Annexure 4, was laid against the petitioners in both the cases. Since
no materials against any public servants were found, the charges under the
Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, were dropped and hence, the chargesheet
was submitted in the Court of Special Judicial Magistrate, Assam, Guwahati, for
offences under Section 120B/420/409 IPC against the petitioners in both the

cases.

[10] Heard Mr. Diganta Das, learned Senior Counsel, appearing for
the petitioners in both the cases and also Mr. S.C. Keyal, learned Standing

Counsel, CBI.

[11] In the course of arguments, Mr. Das, learned Senior Counsel for

the petitioners laid emphasis on three aspects of law:

Firstly, the learned Special Judge could not have ordered re-investigation
of the case as re-investigation means fresh investigation, and hence, could

not have been so ordered

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 5 of 26
Secondly, for the offence committed by Company, if any, no vicarious
liability can be attached to the petitioners being Chairman, Directors and

employee of the Company

Thirdly, that, even if the allegations are taken on its face value yet no

offence is made out, and therefore, the chargesheet needs to be quashed.

[12] On the other hand, the learned Standing Counsel, CBI argued
that it is within the ambit of a Court sitting on a report under Section 173 CrPC

to reject the report an order further investigation.

[13] The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners has placed reliance
on the cases of Vinay Tyagi v. Irshad Ali, reported in (2013) 5 SCC 762, Anju
Chaudhary v. State of U.P., reported in (2013) 6 SCC 384, Rama Chaudhary v.
State of Bihar, reported in (2009) 6 SCC 346, Chandra Babu v. State, reported in
(2015) 8 SCC 774, and State of Orissa v. Mahima, reported in (2007) 15 SCC

580.

[14] In Mahima (supra), the Orissa High Court had quashed a further
investigation done by the Crime Branch on the ground of abuse of process. As
against the order of the Orissa High Court, the State preferred an appeal. In the
context of the factual scenario, the Hon’ble Supreme Court re-iterated the law
laid down in Hemant Dhasmana vs CBI, reported in (2001) 7 SCC 536 holding
that power of police to conduct further investigation in terms of Section 173 (8)

Cr.PC is unfettered.

[15] In Rama Chaudhary (supra), the police after investigation had laid
a charge sheet against the accused persons. In the course of trial, a

supplementary charge sheet was laid against the accused person, wherein the

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 6 of 26
Investigating Agency had mentioned the name of 8 new witnesses. The prayer of
the prosecution to examine those witnesses was allowed by the Sessions Judge.
Aggrieved by the order of Sessions Judge, the accused preferred a Criminal
Revision before the Hon’ble High Court of Patna.The order of Sessions Judge
was upheld by the Hon’ble High Court. As against the order of High Court, the
accused approached the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court, while upholding
the order of High Court as well as the Court of Session, held that it is settled law
that carrying out further investigation, even after filing of the charge-sheet, is a
statutory right of the police. The material collected in further investigation

cannot be rejected only because it has been filed at the stage of the trial.

[16] The other relevant observation of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in
Rama Chaudhary (supra), was that the police has a right to “further”
investigation under sub-section (8) of Section 173 but not “fresh investigation” or
“reinvestigation”. The meaning of “further” is additional, more, or
supplemental. “Further” investigation, therefore, is the continuation of the
earlier investigation and not a fresh investigation or reinvestigation to be started
ab initio wiping out the earlier investigation altogether. It further held that Subsection (8) of Section 173 clearly envisages that on completion of further
investigation, the investigating agency has to forward to the Magistrate a
“further” report and not a fresh report regarding the “further” evidence

obtained during such investigation.

[17] In Vinay Tyagi v. Irshad Ali, reported in (2013) 5 SCC 762, as
relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners, the following

questions came up for consideration before the Supreme Court:

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 7 of 26
(i) Whether in exercise of its powers under Section 173 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short “the Code”), the trial court
has the jurisdiction to ignore any one of the reports, where there are
two reports by the same or different investigating agencies in

furtherance of the orders of a court? If so, to what effect?

(ii) Whether the Central Bureau of Investigation (for short “CBI”) is
empowered to conduct “fresh”/ “reinvestigation” when the
cognizance has already been taken by the court of competent
jurisdiction on the basis of a police report under Section 173 of the

Code?

[18] In the course of deliberations, the Hon’ble Supreme Court in
Vinay Tyagi v. Irshad Ali, reported in (2013) 5 SCC 762, held that investigation

can be of the following kinds:
(i) Initial investigation,
(ii) Further investigation,
(iii) Fresh or de novo or reinvestigation.

[19] The “initial investigation” is the one which the empowered police
officer shall conduct in furtherance of registration of an FIR. Such investigation
itself can lead to filing of a final report under Section 173(2) of the Code and
shall take within its ambit the investigation which the empowered officer shall
conduct in furtherance of an order for investigation passed by the court of

competent jurisdiction in terms of Section 156(3) of the Code.

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 8 of 26
[20] “Further investigation” is where the investigating officer obtains
further oral or documentary evidence after the final report has been filed before
the court in terms of Section 173(8). This power is vested with the executive. It is
the continuation of previous investigation, and therefore, is understood and
described as “further investigation”. The scope of such investigation is restricted
to the discovery of further oral and documentary evidence. Its purpose is to
bring the true facts before the court even if they are discovered at a subsequent
stage to the primary investigation. It is commonly described as “supplementary
report”. “Supplementary report” would be the correct expression as the
subsequent investigation is meant and intended to supplement the primary
investigation conducted by the empowered police officer. Another significant
feature of further investigation is that it does not have the effect of wiping out,
directly or impliedly, the initial investigation conducted by the investigating
agency. This is a kind of continuation of the previous investigation. The basis is
discovery of fresh evidence and in continuation of the same offence and chain of
events relating to the same occurrence incidental thereto. In other words, it has
to be understood in complete contradistinction to a “reinvestigation”, “fresh” or

“de novo” investigation.

[21] However, in the case of a “fresh investigation”, “reinvestigation”
or “de novo investigation” there has to be a definite order of the court. The
order of the court unambiguously should state as to whether the previous
investigation, for reasons to be recorded, is incapable of being acted upon.
Neither the investigating agency nor the Magistrate has any power to order or
conduct “fresh investigation”. This is primarily for the reason that it would be

opposed to the scheme of the Code. It is essential that even an order of

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 9 of 26
“fresh”/“de novo” investigation passed by the higher judiciary should always be
coupled with a specific direction as to the fate of the investigation already
conducted. The cases where such direction can be issued are few and far
between. This is based upon a fundamental principle of our criminal
jurisprudence which is that it is the right of a suspect or an accused to have a just
and fair investigation and trial. This principle flows from the constitutional
mandate contained in Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution of India. Where the
investigation ex facie is unfair, tainted, mala fide and smacks of foul play, the
courts would set aside such an investigation and direct fresh or de novo
investigation and, if necessary, even by another independent investigating

agency.

[22] In Chandra Babu v. State, reported in (2015) 8 SCC 774, also
relied upon by the learned Standing Counsel, CBI, again an occasion arose
before the Hon’ble Supreme Court regarding the powers of Magistrate to pass
orders on further investigation and re-investigation. The Supreme Court
eventually held that under the Code of Criminal Procedure a Magistrate has

power to order further investigation but not reinvestigation.

[23] In view of the cases relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel, |
believe, it is not in dispute that once the Magistrate receives a report under
Section 173 CrPC on completion of investigation, ordering further investigation

is one of the courses open to the Magistrate.

[24] | may recall here the case of Abhinandan Jha v. Dinesh Mishra,
reported in (AIR 1968 SC 117) wherein the Supreme Court had the occasion to

deal with the question as to what is the position, when the Magistrate is dealing

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 10 of 26
with a report submitted by the police, under Section 173, that no case is made

out for sending up an accused for trial, which report is called as a ‘final report’?

[25] It was held in Abhinandan Jha (supra), that even in those cases, if
the Magistrate agrees with the said report, he may accept the final report and
close the proceedings. But there may be instances when the Magistrate may take
the view, on a consideration of the final report, that the opinion formed by the
police is not based on a full and complete investigation in which case the
Magistrate will have ample jurisdiction to give directions to the police, under
Section 156(3), to make a further investigation. That is, if the Magistrate feels,
after considering the final report, that the investigation is unsatisfactory, or
incomplete, or that there is scope for further investigation, it will be open to the
Magistrate to decline to accept the final report and direct the police to make
further investigation, under Section 156(3). The police, after such further
investigation, may submit a charge-sheet, or, again submit a final report,
depending upon the further investigation made by them. If, ultimately, the
Magistrate forms the opinion that the facts, set out in the final report, constitute
an offence, he can take cognizance of the offence, under Section 190(1)(b),

notwithstanding the contrary opinion of the police, expressed in the final report.

[26] Now, when the report, forwarded, under Clause (i) of SubSection (2) of Section 173, by the officer-in-charge of a police station to the
Magistrate, comes up for consideration by the Magistrate, one of two different
situations may, as pointed out in Bhagwant Singh v. Commr. of Police, reported
in (1985) 2 SCC 537 may arise. The report may conclude that an offence appears
to have been committed by a particular person or persons and, in such a case,

the Magistrate may do one of three things: (i) he may accept the report and take

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 11 of 26
‘cognizance’ of the offence or offences, as the case may be, and issue process or
(ii) he may disagree with the report and drop the proceeding or (iii) he may
direct 'further investigation’ under sub-section (3) of Section 156 and require the

police to submit a further report.

[27] In the case of Mithabhai Pashabhai Patel v. State of Gujarat,
reported in (2009) 6 SCC 332, the Hon’ble Supreme Court held that it is,
however, beyond any cavil that “further investigation” and “reinvestigation”
stand on different footing. It may be that in a given situation a superior court in
exercise of its constitutional power, namely, under Articles 226 and 32 of the
Constitution of India could direct a “State” to get an offence investigated and/or
further investigated by a different agency. Direction of a_ reinvestigation,
however, being forbidden in law, no superior court would ordinarily issue such
a direction. A distinction, therefore, exists between a reinvestigation and further

investigation.

[28] The relevant observations of Hon’ble Supreme Court, in

Mithabhai Pashabhai Patel (supra), are reproduced as follows:

“13. It is, however, beyond any cavil that “further investigation”
and “reinvestigation” stand on different footing. It may be that in
a given situation a superior court in exercise of its constitutional
power, namely, under Articles 226 and 32 of the Constitution of
India could direct a “State” to get an offence investigated and/or
further investigated by a different agency. Direction of a
reinvestigation, however, being forbidden in law, no superior

court would ordinarily issue such a direction.”

[29] The discussions, made above, may be summarized in the

following manner:

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 12 of 26
(i) That, police has a right to “further” investigation under sub-section
(8) of Section 173 but not “fresh investigation” or “reinvestigation”.
The meaning of “further” is additional, more, or supplemental.
“Further” investigation, therefore, is the continuation of the earlier
investigation and not a fresh investigation or reinvestigation to be

started ab initio wiping out the earlier investigation altogether.

(ii) In the case of a “fresh investigation”, “reinvestigation” or “de
novo investigation” there has to be a definite order of the court. The
order of the court unambiguously should state as to whether the
previous investigation, for reasons to be recorded, is incapable of
being acted upon. Neither the investigating agency nor the
Magistrate has any power to order or conduct “fresh investigation”.
It is essential that even an order of “fresh”/“de novo” investigation
passed by the higher judiciary should always be coupled with a
specific direction as to the fate of the investigation already

conducted.

(iii) If the Magistrate feels, after considering the final report, that the
investigation is unsatisfactory, or incomplete, or that there is scope
for further investigation, it will be open to the Magistrate to decline
to accept the final report and direct the police to make further
investigation, under Section 156(3). The police, after such further
investigation, may submit a charge-sheet, or, again submit a final

report, depending upon the further investigation made by them.

(iv) If in a given situation a superior court in exercise of its

constitutional power, namely, under Articles 226 and 32 of the

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 13 of 26
Constitution of India directs a “State” to get an offence investigated
and/or further investigated by a different agency wiping out previous
investigation such investigation would be called re-investigation.
Direction of a reinvestigation, however, being forbidden in law, no
superior court would ordinarily issue such a direction. A distinction,

therefore, exists between a reinvestigation and further investigation

[30] Thus, in the light of the cases, discussed hereinbefore, what
emerges is that if the Investigating Agency, after conducting investigation, lays a
charge sheet against the accused persons upon which Magistrate takes cognizance
and trial proceeds, what is permissible for the Police is to submit only additional
and further reports u/s 173 (8) Cr.PC and not a new and fresh report. However,
the said scenario cannot be conceived of in a situation where the Magistrate is
ordering further investigation in exercise of powers u/s 156(3) CrPC by rejecting
the opinion of Investigating Officer. Once such further investigation is ordered a
fresh investigation can be conducted and a new report can be filed and there
appears no hindrance in law that new opinion cannot be given. If it is argued
that even after ordering further investigation the Investigating Agency must stick
to its previous opinion, then the very purpose of further investigation would be

rendered nugatory.

[31] In the present case so far as the order of the learned Special Judge
is concerned he had ordered a re-investigation by the CBI and by a different
Officer. Keeping aside the use of expression re-investigation in the context of the
order, | may point out that the practice of ordering that investigation shall be
carried out by a particular Officer also came up for discussion in Hemant

Dhasmana v. CBI, reported in (2001) 7 SCC 536, wherein the Supreme Court

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 14 of 26
held in clear terms that it is not within the province of the Magistrate while
exercising the power under Section 173(8) to specify any particular officer to
conduct such investigation, not even to suggest the rank of the officer who
should conduct such investigation. Hence, the order of the learned Special Judge,
that investigation should be conducted by an officer other that Mr. R.C.
Basumatary, was not proper though on this count the order would not stand

vitiated.

[32] Now, coming to the use of expression re-investigation indeed in
view of the law laid down it would not have been permissible for the Special
Judge, to order re-investigation. But, the question which needs to be determined

here is whether by the impugned order a re-investigation has been conducted?

[33] The first test of re-investigation is that a fresh investigation
should, ordinarily, be conducted by an agency other than the one which has
already conducted investigation. The second aspect of re-investigation is

observation regarding previous mala fide investigation.

[34] In the present case, the learned Special Judge has only ordered reinvestigation by CBI, the same agency that conducted the previous investigation.
Secondly, there is no observation regarding any mala fides on the part of the
investigating agency regarding previous investigation. Hence, even though the
expression used is re-investigation, infact, what the learned Special Judge meant
was further investigation. The use of expression re-investigation, in the context
of present case, has to be termed as misnomer or a legally inaccurate expression.
Thus, not much can be read and should be read into the expression re
investigation when otherwise only further investigation has been conducted in

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 15 of 26
terms of the power conferred by Section 156(3) CrPC which the learned Special

Judge possessed.

[35] Thus, the order of the learned Special Judge, cannot be assailed

on this ground.

[36] Now, coming to the other leg of arguments, made by the learned
Senior Counsel for the petitioners, about corporate criminal liability how far a
juristic person can be made criminally liable for offences remained an unsettled
issue till the case of /ridium India Telecom Ltd. v. Motorola Inc., reported in
(2011) 1 SCC 74. \n this case, Iridium India had filed a criminal complaint against
Motorola Inc. alleging commission of offence under Section 420/120B IPC. The
complaint was quashed by the Bombay High Court. When the matter was
challenged in Hon’ble Supreme Court, by Iridium India, one of the grounds
taken by them was that the respondent Company cannot hide behind the
defence that the Company is incapable of possessing the necessary mens rea for
commission of the offence of cheating. While answering the rival arguments
made on the point of criminal liability of a corporate body the Hon’ble Supreme
Court, in /ridium India Telecom Ltd. (supra), held in categorical terms that a
corporation is virtually in the same position as any individual and may be
convicted of common law as well as statutory offences including those requiring
mens rea. The criminal liability of a corporation would arise when an offence is
committed in relation to the business of the corporation by a person or body of
persons in control of its affairs. In such circumstances, it would be necessary to
ascertain that the degree and control of the person or body of persons is so

intense that a corporation may be said to think and act through the person or

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 16 of 26
the body of persons. Mens rea is attributed to corporations on the principle of

“alter ego” of the company.

[37]

The relevant paragraph in /ridium India Telecom Lid. (supra), is

reproduced as follows;

[38]

63... it becomes evident that a corporation is virtually in the
same position as any individual and may be convicted of
common law as well as statutory offences including those
requiring mens rea. The criminal liability of a corporation would
arise when an offence is committed in relation to the business of
the corporation by a person or body of persons in control of its
affairs. In such circumstances, it would be necessary to ascertain
that the degree and control of the person or body of persons is so
intense that a corporation may be said to think and act through
the person or the body of persons. The position of law on this
issue in Canada is almost the same. Mens rea is attributed to

corporations on the principle of “alter ego” of the company.

It was further held that a company/corporation cannot escape

liability for a criminal offence merely because the punishment prescribed is that

of imprisonment and fine.

[39]

The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners has referred to the

cases of Sunil Bharti Mittal vs CBI, reported in (2015) 4 SCC 609, Thermax

Limited vs K.M. Johny, reported in (2011) 13 SCC 412, Asoke Basak v. State of

Maharashtra, reported in (2010) 10 SCC 660, Maksud Saiyed vs State of Gujrat,

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 17 of 26
reported in (2008) 5 SCC 668, and S.K. Alagh vs State of U.P, reported in

(2008) 5 SCC 662.

[40] In Sunil Bharti Mittal (supra), a charge sheet was laid against 4
persons. However, when the matter was taken up for the cognizance, the Special
Judge held that Mr Sunil Bharti Mittal was Chairman-cum-Managing Director of
Bharti Cellular Ltd., Mr. Asim Ghosh was Managing Director of Hutchison Max
Telecom (P) Ltd. and Mr Ravi Ruia was a Director in Sterling Cellular Ltd., who
used to chair the meetings of its Board. According to him, in that capacity, these
persons, prima facie, could be treated as controlling the affairs of the respective
companies and represent the directing mind and will of each company. They
were, thus, “alter ego” of their respective companies and the acts of the
companies could be attributed and imputed to them. On this premise, the
Special Judge felt that there was enough material on record to proceed against
these three persons as well. Thus, while taking cognizance of the case, he
decided to issue summons not only to the four accused named in the charge
sheet but the aforesaid three persons as well.

[41] On the facts of the case in Sunil Bharti Mittal (supra) itself it can
be said that this case may not be of any assistance to decide the present subject
matter as it is not the case of the petitioners that without they being named in
the charge sheet, processes have been issued against them without recording a
prima facie observation regarding their liability. The admitted position is that

petitioners have been charge sheeted as accused in the case in hand.

[42] In any view of the matter, the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Sunil
Bharti Mittal (supra), elucidated the law laid down in /ridium India (supra), and

held that the legal proposition that is laid down in the aforesaid judgment in

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 18 of 26
Iridium India (supra) is that if the person or group of persons who control the
affairs of the company commit an offence with a criminal intent, their criminality

can be imputed to the company as well as they are “alter ego” of the company.

[43] The cases of Thermax Ltd. v. K.M. Johny, reported in (2011) 13
SCC 412, Asoke Basak v. State of Maharashtra, reported in (2010) 10 SCC 660,
Maksud Saiyed v. State of Gujarat, reported in (2008) 5 SCC 668 andAsoke
Basak v. State of Maharashtra, reported in (2010) 10 SCC 660 do not seem to
have deviated from the law laid down in /ridium India (supra), rather on factual
analysis the Hon’ble Supreme Court found that no case is made out. Whether in
the present case offence is made out against the petitioners is being discussed

hereinafter.

[44] In $.K. Alagh v. State of U.P., reported in (2008) 5 SCC 662, a
criminal complaint was filed against the Managing Director and the General
Manager of Britannia Industries Ltd for offence under Section 405 IPC. The
company itself was not made an accused. It was in these context the Hon’ble
Supreme Court had held that as, admittedly, drafts were drawn in the name of
the Company, the Managing Director, cannot be said to have committed an
offence under Section 406 of the Penal Code. If and when a é statute
contemplates creation of such a legal fiction, it provides specifically therefor. In
absence of any provision laid down under the statute, a Director of a Company
Or an employee cannot be held to be vicariously liable for any offence

committed by the Company itself.

[45] The ratio of $.K. Alagh (supra) is not found to be applicable in
the present case because in §$.K. Alagh (supra), it was the company which was

alleged to have committed the offence, but instead of making the company as

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 19 of 26
accused its Managing Director was impleaded as accused on the principles of
vicarious liability. However, in the present case company has been made accused
and the petitioners are alleged to be the directing mind and will of the company

as its Directors.

[46] What emerges from the discussion undertaken hereinbefore is as

follows:

(i) A corporation is virtually in the same position as any individual
and may be convicted of common law as well as statutory offences
including those requiring mens rea. The criminal liability of a
corporation would arise when an offence is committed in relation to
the business of the corporation by a person or body of persons in
control of its affairs. In such circumstances, it would be necessary to
ascertain that the degree and control of the person or body of
persons is so intense that a corporation may be said to think and act

through the person or the body of persons.

(ii) If the company is not impleaded as an accused its Managing
Director or any other Official cannot be made vicariously liable for

the acts committed by the company

(iii) If on a reading of uncontroverted facts no offence is made out a

complaint or proceeding can be quashed.

[47] It now needs to be seen as to what is the nature of allegations

against the petitioners.

[48] The petitioners 1, 2 and 3 in Criminal Petition No. 192/2016 are

the Directors of Meghalaya Cements Ltd, a company registered under the

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 20 of 26
Companies Act, 1956 and the petitioner No. 4 is an employee of the said
Company. On the other hand, the petitioner in Criminal Petition No. 189/2016
is the Chairman of said Meghalaya Cements Ltd. On a reading of the
chargesheet, dated 27.3.2014, appended as Annexure 4 to this petition, the
allegation against the petitioners is that during the period of 2008-2011 some
officials of North Eastern Coal Fields, CIL, entered into criminal conspiracy with
Sri Kailash Chand Lohia, Director of Meghalaya Cements Ltd. to facilitate misuse
of coal supplied from NEC, CIL under subsidized rates as per National Coal
Distribution Policy of Govt. of India. As per the Fuel Supply Agreement, done
between NEC/CIL and Sri Kailash Chand Lohia for Meghalaya Cements Ltd, coal
to the tune of 38,000 metric tonnes per annum was allotted to the Unit.
Accordingly, the firm had lifted 70,413 metric tonnes of coal from NEC, CIL.But,
instead of transporting the said coal to Meghalaya Cements Ltd, the Director
diverted the said coal for use in M/s K.D. Coke, Jorabat. The coal was allotted
and lifted at the rate of Rs 3680/- per tonne and rate fixed under E-auction
wasRs 3851/-. The quantity of coal lifted by Meghalaya Cements Ltd would have
fetched an amount of Rs 15,50,25,136/- to the CIL it sold through e-auction

open market. Hence, wrongful loss was caused to CIL.

[49] As against the heading “Charge” in Annexure 4, an elaborate
factual allegations have been portrayed. Though there are enough incriminating
circumstances as to how the coal obtained at subsidized rate was misused for
purpose other than the purpose meant for Meghalaya Cements Ltd. it would be
sufficient for the purpose of present adjudication if some sets of allegations are

brought on record.

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 21 of 26
[50] One of the allegation is that during investigation it was revealed
that consignment of coal lifted from NEC, CIL had to be transported through
Taxation Check Gate, Byrnihat, Megahalaya. It was revealed that a total of 2956
numbers of trucks was shown to have crossed Byrnihat Check gate carrying coal
from NEC, CIL in the name of Meghalaya Cements Ltd to its factory premises
Topcem Cements. These movements of trucks were verified with the
Commissioner of Taxes, Meghalaya, Shillong with a request to verify whether
the alleged movement of 2956 numbers of trucks infact took place. The
Commissioner of Taxes in his communications to CBI informed that a total of
295 numbers of truck had crossed the Taxation Check Gate. The Superintendent
of Taxes, however, informed that a total of 278 numbers of truck had crossed
the check Gate during the period of 1/7/2008 to 31/03/2011. Again, as per the
information received from the Superintendent of Taxes, of the total 278 trucks
not all the trucks had transported coal, rather; some of the trucks had
transported Fly Ash, Coke, LPG etc though the road permits show that coal was
transported. The Investigating Agency, thus, infers that if one truck can transport
23 MT coal, then 295 trucks could transport only 6785 MT of coal, thereby

showing, that 63,628 MT coal was diverted by Meghalaya Cements Ltd.

[51] The other allegation is that Office Stamp of Taxation Check Gate,
the Seal impression of Taxation Inspector appearing on the Road Challan,
Permits, Transport Documents of the Meghalaya Cements Ltd. transporting the

coal, were fake stamp and fake stamp signatures.

[52] These two sets of allegations, among a host of other allegations
are quite incriminating in nature. In State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal, reported in

1992 Supp (1) SCC 335, certain circumstances were laid down by the Hon’ble

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 22 of 26
Supreme Court when a complaint/FIR can be quashed. Those circumstances are

as follows:

(i) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the
complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in
their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a

case against the accused.

(ii) Where the allegations in the first information report and other
materials, if any, accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable
offence, justifying an investigation by police officers under Section
156(1) of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the

purview of Section 155(2) of the Code.

(iii) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or
complaint and the evidence collected in support of the same do not
disclose the commission of any offence and make out a case against

the accused.

(iv) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable
offence but constitute only a non-cognizable offence, no investigation
is permitted by a police officer without an order of a Magistrate as

contemplated under Section 155(2) of the Code.

(v) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd
and inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person
can ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for

proceeding against the accused.

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 23 of 26
(vi) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the
provisions of the Code or the concerned Act (under which a criminal
proceeding is instituted) to the institution and continuance of the
proceedings and/or where there is a specific provision in the Code or
the concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for the grievance of

the aggrieved party.

(vii) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala
fide and/or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an
ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a

view to spite him due to private and personal grudge.

[53] Applying the test laid down in the case of Bhajan Lal (supra) it
cannot be said, in the context of present case, that even uncontroverted
allegations do not make out any case. As there are strong prima facie materials
of tax evasion, cheating, and forgery, on facts, no case is made out for quashing

the proceedings.

[54] There is yet another aspect on which arguments have been
advanced and which needs appreciation. It is the contention of petitioners,
particularly in Criminal Petition No. 192/2016, that petitioner No. 4 Sri
Girdharilal Bathwal is only a Manager (Stores) and that he has been wrongly
implicated in this case. However, on perusal of charge sheet, Annexure 4, it is
found that petitioner No. 4, as Senior Manager (Stores), created false records of
receipt of coal consignments. | believe, embarking into any kind of inquiry to
ascertain the truthfulness of such allegations, at this stage, would be highly

prejudicial to the prosecution case. Hence, the argument has no force.

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 24 of 26
[55] As to the culpability of the petitioners, in both the cases, | may
point out certain observation of Courts in England, which have quoted with

approval in Iridium India (supra).

[56] In Director of Public Prosecutions v. Kent and Sussex Contractors
Lid. reported in (1944) 1 All ER 119 (DC) it was held that a body corporate is a
“person” to whom, amongst the various attributes it may have, there should be
imputed the attribute of a mind capable of knowing and forming an intention —
indeed it is much too late in the day to suggest the contrary. It can only know or
form an intention through its human agents, but circumstances may be such that

the knowledge of the agent must be imputed to the body corporate.

[57] Lord Denning in Bolton (H.L.) (Engg.) Co. Lid. v. T.J. Graham &
Sons Lid. reported in (1957) 1 QB 159 summarized his findings in the following

words:

A company may in many ways be likened to a human body. They have a
brain and a nerve centre which controls what they do. They also have
hands which hold the tools and act in accordance with directions from
the centre. Some of the people in the company are mere servants and
agents who are nothing more than hands to do the work and cannot be
said to represent the mind or will. Others are directors and managers
who represent the directing mind and will of the company, and control
what they do. The state of mind of these managers is the state of mind of
the company and Is treated by the law as such. $0 you will find that in
cases where the law requires personal fault as a condition of liability in
tort, the fault of the manager will be the personal fault of the company.

That is made clear in Lord Haldane’s speech in Lennard’s Carrying Co.

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 25 of 26
Ltd. v. Asiatic Petroleurn Co. Ltd. So also in the criminal law, in cases
where the law requires a guilty mind as a condition of a criminal offence,
the guilty mind of the directors or the managers will render the company

themselves guilty.

[58] The petitioners being directly involved in the affairs of Meghalaya
Cements Ltd, and admittedly holding positions like Chairman and Directors of
the Company cannot get any reprieve by way of an application under Section
482 Cr.PC because of the nature of materials unearthed during investigation. It
would, thus, not be proper to invoke the jurisdiction vested in this Court under
Section 482 Cr.PC and quash the proceedings of GR 854/2014 pending in the

Court of Special Judicial Magistrate, Assam, Guwahati.

[59] Lastly, an argument has been made with reference to the order in
WP (C) 243/12 of this Court in order to show that dispute is civil in nature.
However, in view of the incriminating materials, already discussed hereinbefore,
this Court is not inclined to go into deeper aspects of the merits of defence. The
petitioners will be able to take all such defences as would be available to them

under law when the trial proceeds.

[60] In the result, the petitions are dismissed. The interim order passed

earlier stands vacated.

JUDGMENT & ORDER (CAV)

By way of this common judgment and order, | propose to
dispose of the Criminal Petition No. 189/2016 and Criminal Petition No.

192/2016 preferred under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

[2] It may be mentioned at the outset that both these cases were
heard and reserved for verdict. However, certain discrepancy was noticed in the
nomenclature of the case, sought to be quashed, hence the discrepancy was

brought to the notice of learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners. The learned

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 2 of 26
Senior Counsel for the petitioners, having realized the error, sought to file a
correction/modification application and accordingly vide |.A (Crl) No. 603/2017
in Criminal Petition No. 189/2016 and 1.A (Crl) No. 608/2017 in Criminal

Petition No. 192/2016 amendments were sought to be introduced.

[3] The amendments, sought to be introduced in Criminal Petition
No. 189/2016 and Criminal Petition No. 192/2016, were heard on 24.08.2017
and after considering that the proposed amendments are only clarificatory in
nature, prayers in both the Interlocutory Applications were allowed. The
amendments in Criminal Petition No. 189/2016 and Criminal Petition No.

192/2016 shall now be read as part of original petitions.

[4] The amendments, sought for, can be precisely stated as follows:

L. The Case No. in the original application was mentioned as CR

854/2016 which has been amended as GR 854/2016

ii. In the cause title as well as in the body of the petition it was
stated that the case is presently pending in the Court of learned
Chief Judicial Magistrate, Kamrup (Metro), Guwahati which
has, now, been corrected as learned Special Judicial Magistrate,

Assam, Guwahati

[5] Having dealt with the clarificatory aspects of the case | now

proceed to decide the case as follows;

[6] The petitioners 1, 2 and 3 in Criminal Petition No. 192/2016 are
the Directors of Meghalaya Cements Ltd, a company registered under the
Companies Act, 1956 and the petitioner No. 4 is an employee of the said

Company. On the other hand, the petitioner in Criminal Petition No. 189/2016

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 3 of 26
is the Chairman of said Meghalaya Cements Ltd. On a reading of the chargesheet
dated 27.3.2014, appended as Annexure 4 to this petition, the allegation against
the petitioners is that during the period of 2008-2011 some officials of North
Eastern Coal Fields, CIL, (hereinafter referred to NEC, CIL) entered into criminal
conspiracy with Sri Kailash Chand Lohia, Director of Meghalaya Cements Ltd. to
facilitate misuse of coal supplied from NEC, CIL under subsidized rates as per
National Coal Distribution Policy of Govt. of India. As per the Fuel Supply
Agreement done between NEC/CIL and Sri Kailash Chand Lohia for Meghalaya
Cements Ltd, coal to the tune of 38,000 metric tonnes per annum was allotted
to the Unit. Accordingly, the firm had lifted 70,413 metric tonnes of coal from
NEC, CIL but instead of transporting the said coal to Meghalaya Cements Ltd the
Director diverted the said coal for use in M/s K.D. Coke, Jorabat. The coal was
allotted and lifted at the rate of Rs 3680/- per tonne and rate fixed under Eauction is Rs 3851. The quantity of coal lifted by Meghalaya Cements Ltd would
have fetched an amount of Rs 15,50,25,136/- to the CIL if sold through e-auction
open market. Hence, wrongful loss was caused to CIL. Apart from the
allegations of cheating there are some other allegations that the petitioners
having entered into conspiracy created forged documents and used those
documents for the purpose of cheating. A chargesheet, thus, for the offences
under Section 420/468 read with Section 120B IPC has been laid against the

petitioners in both the cases.

[7] An FIR was lodged in this regard by Mr. H.C. Nath, IPS, Head of
Branch, CBI/ACB/Guwahati on 12.4.2011. The FIR was investigated, and after

investigation, a closure report, under Section 173 CrPC, was laid on 27.6.2012.

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 4 of 26
[8] As against the Closure Report, under Section 173 CrPC, the
impugned order, dated 4.8.12, was passed by learned Special Judge, Assam,
Guwahati, holding that since many aspects were left out during investigation the
Closure report cannot be accepted, and thereafter, the learned Special Judge
ordered re-investigation to be conducted by S$.P, CBI/ACB and to entrust a
competent officer other than Mr. R.C. Basumatary, to investigate the case and

submit report in final form.

[9] In the investigation that ensued thereafter, the impugned
chargesheet, Annexure 4, was laid against the petitioners in both the cases. Since
no materials against any public servants were found, the charges under the
Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, were dropped and hence, the chargesheet
was submitted in the Court of Special Judicial Magistrate, Assam, Guwahati, for
offences under Section 120B/420/409 IPC against the petitioners in both the

cases.

[10] Heard Mr. Diganta Das, learned Senior Counsel, appearing for
the petitioners in both the cases and also Mr. S.C. Keyal, learned Standing

Counsel, CBI.

[11] In the course of arguments, Mr. Das, learned Senior Counsel for

the petitioners laid emphasis on three aspects of law:

Firstly, the learned Special Judge could not have ordered re-investigation
of the case as re-investigation means fresh investigation, and hence, could

not have been so ordered

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 5 of 26
Secondly, for the offence committed by Company, if any, no vicarious
liability can be attached to the petitioners being Chairman, Directors and

employee of the Company

Thirdly, that, even if the allegations are taken on its face value yet no

offence is made out, and therefore, the chargesheet needs to be quashed.

[12] On the other hand, the learned Standing Counsel, CBI argued
that it is within the ambit of a Court sitting on a report under Section 173 CrPC

to reject the report an order further investigation.

[13] The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners has placed reliance
on the cases of Vinay Tyagi v. Irshad Ali, reported in (2013) 5 SCC 762, Anju
Chaudhary v. State of U.P., reported in (2013) 6 SCC 384, Rama Chaudhary v.
State of Bihar, reported in (2009) 6 SCC 346, Chandra Babu v. State, reported in
(2015) 8 SCC 774, and State of Orissa v. Mahima, reported in (2007) 15 SCC

580.

[14] In Mahima (supra), the Orissa High Court had quashed a further
investigation done by the Crime Branch on the ground of abuse of process. As
against the order of the Orissa High Court, the State preferred an appeal. In the
context of the factual scenario, the Hon’ble Supreme Court re-iterated the law
laid down in Hemant Dhasmana vs CBI, reported in (2001) 7 SCC 536 holding
that power of police to conduct further investigation in terms of Section 173 (8)

Cr.PC is unfettered.

[15] In Rama Chaudhary (supra), the police after investigation had laid
a charge sheet against the accused persons. In the course of trial, a

supplementary charge sheet was laid against the accused person, wherein the

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 6 of 26
Investigating Agency had mentioned the name of 8 new witnesses. The prayer of
the prosecution to examine those witnesses was allowed by the Sessions Judge.
Aggrieved by the order of Sessions Judge, the accused preferred a Criminal
Revision before the Hon’ble High Court of Patna.The order of Sessions Judge
was upheld by the Hon’ble High Court. As against the order of High Court, the
accused approached the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court, while upholding
the order of High Court as well as the Court of Session, held that it is settled law
that carrying out further investigation, even after filing of the charge-sheet, is a
statutory right of the police. The material collected in further investigation

cannot be rejected only because it has been filed at the stage of the trial.

[16] The other relevant observation of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in
Rama Chaudhary (supra), was that the police has a right to “further”
investigation under sub-section (8) of Section 173 but not “fresh investigation” or
“reinvestigation”. The meaning of “further” is additional, more, or
supplemental. “Further” investigation, therefore, is the continuation of the
earlier investigation and not a fresh investigation or reinvestigation to be started
ab initio wiping out the earlier investigation altogether. It further held that Subsection (8) of Section 173 clearly envisages that on completion of further
investigation, the investigating agency has to forward to the Magistrate a
“further” report and not a fresh report regarding the “further” evidence

obtained during such investigation.

[17] In Vinay Tyagi v. Irshad Ali, reported in (2013) 5 SCC 762, as
relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners, the following

questions came up for consideration before the Supreme Court:

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 7 of 26
(i) Whether in exercise of its powers under Section 173 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short “the Code”), the trial court
has the jurisdiction to ignore any one of the reports, where there are
two reports by the same or different investigating agencies in

furtherance of the orders of a court? If so, to what effect?

(ii) Whether the Central Bureau of Investigation (for short “CBI”) is
empowered to conduct “fresh”/ “reinvestigation” when the
cognizance has already been taken by the court of competent
jurisdiction on the basis of a police report under Section 173 of the

Code?

[18] In the course of deliberations, the Hon’ble Supreme Court in
Vinay Tyagi v. Irshad Ali, reported in (2013) 5 SCC 762, held that investigation

can be of the following kinds:
(i) Initial investigation,
(ii) Further investigation,
(iii) Fresh or de novo or reinvestigation.

[19] The “initial investigation” is the one which the empowered police
officer shall conduct in furtherance of registration of an FIR. Such investigation
itself can lead to filing of a final report under Section 173(2) of the Code and
shall take within its ambit the investigation which the empowered officer shall
conduct in furtherance of an order for investigation passed by the court of

competent jurisdiction in terms of Section 156(3) of the Code.

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 8 of 26
[20] “Further investigation” is where the investigating officer obtains
further oral or documentary evidence after the final report has been filed before
the court in terms of Section 173(8). This power is vested with the executive. It is
the continuation of previous investigation, and therefore, is understood and
described as “further investigation”. The scope of such investigation is restricted
to the discovery of further oral and documentary evidence. Its purpose is to
bring the true facts before the court even if they are discovered at a subsequent
stage to the primary investigation. It is commonly described as “supplementary
report”. “Supplementary report” would be the correct expression as the
subsequent investigation is meant and intended to supplement the primary
investigation conducted by the empowered police officer. Another significant
feature of further investigation is that it does not have the effect of wiping out,
directly or impliedly, the initial investigation conducted by the investigating
agency. This is a kind of continuation of the previous investigation. The basis is
discovery of fresh evidence and in continuation of the same offence and chain of
events relating to the same occurrence incidental thereto. In other words, it has
to be understood in complete contradistinction to a “reinvestigation”, “fresh” or

“de novo” investigation.

[21] However, in the case of a “fresh investigation”, “reinvestigation”
or “de novo investigation” there has to be a definite order of the court. The
order of the court unambiguously should state as to whether the previous
investigation, for reasons to be recorded, is incapable of being acted upon.
Neither the investigating agency nor the Magistrate has any power to order or
conduct “fresh investigation”. This is primarily for the reason that it would be

opposed to the scheme of the Code. It is essential that even an order of

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 9 of 26
“fresh”/“de novo” investigation passed by the higher judiciary should always be
coupled with a specific direction as to the fate of the investigation already
conducted. The cases where such direction can be issued are few and far
between. This is based upon a fundamental principle of our criminal
jurisprudence which is that it is the right of a suspect or an accused to have a just
and fair investigation and trial. This principle flows from the constitutional
mandate contained in Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution of India. Where the
investigation ex facie is unfair, tainted, mala fide and smacks of foul play, the
courts would set aside such an investigation and direct fresh or de novo
investigation and, if necessary, even by another independent investigating

agency.

[22] In Chandra Babu v. State, reported in (2015) 8 SCC 774, also
relied upon by the learned Standing Counsel, CBI, again an occasion arose
before the Hon’ble Supreme Court regarding the powers of Magistrate to pass
orders on further investigation and re-investigation. The Supreme Court
eventually held that under the Code of Criminal Procedure a Magistrate has

power to order further investigation but not reinvestigation.

[23] In view of the cases relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel, |
believe, it is not in dispute that once the Magistrate receives a report under
Section 173 CrPC on completion of investigation, ordering further investigation

is one of the courses open to the Magistrate.

[24] | may recall here the case of Abhinandan Jha v. Dinesh Mishra,
reported in (AIR 1968 SC 117) wherein the Supreme Court had the occasion to

deal with the question as to what is the position, when the Magistrate is dealing

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 10 of 26
with a report submitted by the police, under Section 173, that no case is made

out for sending up an accused for trial, which report is called as a ‘final report’?

[25] It was held in Abhinandan Jha (supra), that even in those cases, if
the Magistrate agrees with the said report, he may accept the final report and
close the proceedings. But there may be instances when the Magistrate may take
the view, on a consideration of the final report, that the opinion formed by the
police is not based on a full and complete investigation in which case the
Magistrate will have ample jurisdiction to give directions to the police, under
Section 156(3), to make a further investigation. That is, if the Magistrate feels,
after considering the final report, that the investigation is unsatisfactory, or
incomplete, or that there is scope for further investigation, it will be open to the
Magistrate to decline to accept the final report and direct the police to make
further investigation, under Section 156(3). The police, after such further
investigation, may submit a charge-sheet, or, again submit a final report,
depending upon the further investigation made by them. If, ultimately, the
Magistrate forms the opinion that the facts, set out in the final report, constitute
an offence, he can take cognizance of the offence, under Section 190(1)(b),

notwithstanding the contrary opinion of the police, expressed in the final report.

[26] Now, when the report, forwarded, under Clause (i) of SubSection (2) of Section 173, by the officer-in-charge of a police station to the
Magistrate, comes up for consideration by the Magistrate, one of two different
situations may, as pointed out in Bhagwant Singh v. Commr. of Police, reported
in (1985) 2 SCC 537 may arise. The report may conclude that an offence appears
to have been committed by a particular person or persons and, in such a case,

the Magistrate may do one of three things: (i) he may accept the report and take

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 11 of 26
‘cognizance’ of the offence or offences, as the case may be, and issue process or
(ii) he may disagree with the report and drop the proceeding or (iii) he may
direct 'further investigation’ under sub-section (3) of Section 156 and require the

police to submit a further report.

[27] In the case of Mithabhai Pashabhai Patel v. State of Gujarat,
reported in (2009) 6 SCC 332, the Hon’ble Supreme Court held that it is,
however, beyond any cavil that “further investigation” and “reinvestigation”
stand on different footing. It may be that in a given situation a superior court in
exercise of its constitutional power, namely, under Articles 226 and 32 of the
Constitution of India could direct a “State” to get an offence investigated and/or
further investigated by a different agency. Direction of a_ reinvestigation,
however, being forbidden in law, no superior court would ordinarily issue such
a direction. A distinction, therefore, exists between a reinvestigation and further

investigation.

[28] The relevant observations of Hon’ble Supreme Court, in

Mithabhai Pashabhai Patel (supra), are reproduced as follows:

“13. It is, however, beyond any cavil that “further investigation”
and “reinvestigation” stand on different footing. It may be that in
a given situation a superior court in exercise of its constitutional
power, namely, under Articles 226 and 32 of the Constitution of
India could direct a “State” to get an offence investigated and/or
further investigated by a different agency. Direction of a
reinvestigation, however, being forbidden in law, no superior

court would ordinarily issue such a direction.”

[29] The discussions, made above, may be summarized in the

following manner:

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 12 of 26
(i) That, police has a right to “further” investigation under sub-section
(8) of Section 173 but not “fresh investigation” or “reinvestigation”.
The meaning of “further” is additional, more, or supplemental.
“Further” investigation, therefore, is the continuation of the earlier
investigation and not a fresh investigation or reinvestigation to be

started ab initio wiping out the earlier investigation altogether.

(ii) In the case of a “fresh investigation”, “reinvestigation” or “de
novo investigation” there has to be a definite order of the court. The
order of the court unambiguously should state as to whether the
previous investigation, for reasons to be recorded, is incapable of
being acted upon. Neither the investigating agency nor the
Magistrate has any power to order or conduct “fresh investigation”.
It is essential that even an order of “fresh”/“de novo” investigation
passed by the higher judiciary should always be coupled with a
specific direction as to the fate of the investigation already

conducted.

(iii) If the Magistrate feels, after considering the final report, that the
investigation is unsatisfactory, or incomplete, or that there is scope
for further investigation, it will be open to the Magistrate to decline
to accept the final report and direct the police to make further
investigation, under Section 156(3). The police, after such further
investigation, may submit a charge-sheet, or, again submit a final

report, depending upon the further investigation made by them.

(iv) If in a given situation a superior court in exercise of its

constitutional power, namely, under Articles 226 and 32 of the

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 13 of 26
Constitution of India directs a “State” to get an offence investigated
and/or further investigated by a different agency wiping out previous
investigation such investigation would be called re-investigation.
Direction of a reinvestigation, however, being forbidden in law, no
superior court would ordinarily issue such a direction. A distinction,

therefore, exists between a reinvestigation and further investigation

[30] Thus, in the light of the cases, discussed hereinbefore, what
emerges is that if the Investigating Agency, after conducting investigation, lays a
charge sheet against the accused persons upon which Magistrate takes cognizance
and trial proceeds, what is permissible for the Police is to submit only additional
and further reports u/s 173 (8) Cr.PC and not a new and fresh report. However,
the said scenario cannot be conceived of in a situation where the Magistrate is
ordering further investigation in exercise of powers u/s 156(3) CrPC by rejecting
the opinion of Investigating Officer. Once such further investigation is ordered a
fresh investigation can be conducted and a new report can be filed and there
appears no hindrance in law that new opinion cannot be given. If it is argued
that even after ordering further investigation the Investigating Agency must stick
to its previous opinion, then the very purpose of further investigation would be

rendered nugatory.

[31] In the present case so far as the order of the learned Special Judge
is concerned he had ordered a re-investigation by the CBI and by a different
Officer. Keeping aside the use of expression re-investigation in the context of the
order, | may point out that the practice of ordering that investigation shall be
carried out by a particular Officer also came up for discussion in Hemant

Dhasmana v. CBI, reported in (2001) 7 SCC 536, wherein the Supreme Court

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 14 of 26
held in clear terms that it is not within the province of the Magistrate while
exercising the power under Section 173(8) to specify any particular officer to
conduct such investigation, not even to suggest the rank of the officer who
should conduct such investigation. Hence, the order of the learned Special Judge,
that investigation should be conducted by an officer other that Mr. R.C.
Basumatary, was not proper though on this count the order would not stand

vitiated.

[32] Now, coming to the use of expression re-investigation indeed in
view of the law laid down it would not have been permissible for the Special
Judge, to order re-investigation. But, the question which needs to be determined

here is whether by the impugned order a re-investigation has been conducted?

[33] The first test of re-investigation is that a fresh investigation
should, ordinarily, be conducted by an agency other than the one which has
already conducted investigation. The second aspect of re-investigation is

observation regarding previous mala fide investigation.

[34] In the present case, the learned Special Judge has only ordered reinvestigation by CBI, the same agency that conducted the previous investigation.
Secondly, there is no observation regarding any mala fides on the part of the
investigating agency regarding previous investigation. Hence, even though the
expression used is re-investigation, infact, what the learned Special Judge meant
was further investigation. The use of expression re-investigation, in the context
of present case, has to be termed as misnomer or a legally inaccurate expression.
Thus, not much can be read and should be read into the expression re
investigation when otherwise only further investigation has been conducted in

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 15 of 26
terms of the power conferred by Section 156(3) CrPC which the learned Special

Judge possessed.

[35] Thus, the order of the learned Special Judge, cannot be assailed

on this ground.

[36] Now, coming to the other leg of arguments, made by the learned
Senior Counsel for the petitioners, about corporate criminal liability how far a
juristic person can be made criminally liable for offences remained an unsettled
issue till the case of /ridium India Telecom Ltd. v. Motorola Inc., reported in
(2011) 1 SCC 74. \n this case, Iridium India had filed a criminal complaint against
Motorola Inc. alleging commission of offence under Section 420/120B IPC. The
complaint was quashed by the Bombay High Court. When the matter was
challenged in Hon’ble Supreme Court, by Iridium India, one of the grounds
taken by them was that the respondent Company cannot hide behind the
defence that the Company is incapable of possessing the necessary mens rea for
commission of the offence of cheating. While answering the rival arguments
made on the point of criminal liability of a corporate body the Hon’ble Supreme
Court, in /ridium India Telecom Ltd. (supra), held in categorical terms that a
corporation is virtually in the same position as any individual and may be
convicted of common law as well as statutory offences including those requiring
mens rea. The criminal liability of a corporation would arise when an offence is
committed in relation to the business of the corporation by a person or body of
persons in control of its affairs. In such circumstances, it would be necessary to
ascertain that the degree and control of the person or body of persons is so

intense that a corporation may be said to think and act through the person or

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 16 of 26
the body of persons. Mens rea is attributed to corporations on the principle of

“alter ego” of the company.

[37]

The relevant paragraph in /ridium India Telecom Lid. (supra), is

reproduced as follows;

[38]

63... it becomes evident that a corporation is virtually in the
same position as any individual and may be convicted of
common law as well as statutory offences including those
requiring mens rea. The criminal liability of a corporation would
arise when an offence is committed in relation to the business of
the corporation by a person or body of persons in control of its
affairs. In such circumstances, it would be necessary to ascertain
that the degree and control of the person or body of persons is so
intense that a corporation may be said to think and act through
the person or the body of persons. The position of law on this
issue in Canada is almost the same. Mens rea is attributed to

corporations on the principle of “alter ego” of the company.

It was further held that a company/corporation cannot escape

liability for a criminal offence merely because the punishment prescribed is that

of imprisonment and fine.

[39]

The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners has referred to the

cases of Sunil Bharti Mittal vs CBI, reported in (2015) 4 SCC 609, Thermax

Limited vs K.M. Johny, reported in (2011) 13 SCC 412, Asoke Basak v. State of

Maharashtra, reported in (2010) 10 SCC 660, Maksud Saiyed vs State of Gujrat,

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 17 of 26
reported in (2008) 5 SCC 668, and S.K. Alagh vs State of U.P, reported in

(2008) 5 SCC 662.

[40] In Sunil Bharti Mittal (supra), a charge sheet was laid against 4
persons. However, when the matter was taken up for the cognizance, the Special
Judge held that Mr Sunil Bharti Mittal was Chairman-cum-Managing Director of
Bharti Cellular Ltd., Mr. Asim Ghosh was Managing Director of Hutchison Max
Telecom (P) Ltd. and Mr Ravi Ruia was a Director in Sterling Cellular Ltd., who
used to chair the meetings of its Board. According to him, in that capacity, these
persons, prima facie, could be treated as controlling the affairs of the respective
companies and represent the directing mind and will of each company. They
were, thus, “alter ego” of their respective companies and the acts of the
companies could be attributed and imputed to them. On this premise, the
Special Judge felt that there was enough material on record to proceed against
these three persons as well. Thus, while taking cognizance of the case, he
decided to issue summons not only to the four accused named in the charge
sheet but the aforesaid three persons as well.

[41] On the facts of the case in Sunil Bharti Mittal (supra) itself it can
be said that this case may not be of any assistance to decide the present subject
matter as it is not the case of the petitioners that without they being named in
the charge sheet, processes have been issued against them without recording a
prima facie observation regarding their liability. The admitted position is that

petitioners have been charge sheeted as accused in the case in hand.

[42] In any view of the matter, the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Sunil
Bharti Mittal (supra), elucidated the law laid down in /ridium India (supra), and

held that the legal proposition that is laid down in the aforesaid judgment in

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 18 of 26
Iridium India (supra) is that if the person or group of persons who control the
affairs of the company commit an offence with a criminal intent, their criminality

can be imputed to the company as well as they are “alter ego” of the company.

[43] The cases of Thermax Ltd. v. K.M. Johny, reported in (2011) 13
SCC 412, Asoke Basak v. State of Maharashtra, reported in (2010) 10 SCC 660,
Maksud Saiyed v. State of Gujarat, reported in (2008) 5 SCC 668 andAsoke
Basak v. State of Maharashtra, reported in (2010) 10 SCC 660 do not seem to
have deviated from the law laid down in /ridium India (supra), rather on factual
analysis the Hon’ble Supreme Court found that no case is made out. Whether in
the present case offence is made out against the petitioners is being discussed

hereinafter.

[44] In $.K. Alagh v. State of U.P., reported in (2008) 5 SCC 662, a
criminal complaint was filed against the Managing Director and the General
Manager of Britannia Industries Ltd for offence under Section 405 IPC. The
company itself was not made an accused. It was in these context the Hon’ble
Supreme Court had held that as, admittedly, drafts were drawn in the name of
the Company, the Managing Director, cannot be said to have committed an
offence under Section 406 of the Penal Code. If and when a é statute
contemplates creation of such a legal fiction, it provides specifically therefor. In
absence of any provision laid down under the statute, a Director of a Company
Or an employee cannot be held to be vicariously liable for any offence

committed by the Company itself.

[45] The ratio of $.K. Alagh (supra) is not found to be applicable in
the present case because in §$.K. Alagh (supra), it was the company which was

alleged to have committed the offence, but instead of making the company as

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 19 of 26
accused its Managing Director was impleaded as accused on the principles of
vicarious liability. However, in the present case company has been made accused
and the petitioners are alleged to be the directing mind and will of the company

as its Directors.

[46] What emerges from the discussion undertaken hereinbefore is as

follows:

(i) A corporation is virtually in the same position as any individual
and may be convicted of common law as well as statutory offences
including those requiring mens rea. The criminal liability of a
corporation would arise when an offence is committed in relation to
the business of the corporation by a person or body of persons in
control of its affairs. In such circumstances, it would be necessary to
ascertain that the degree and control of the person or body of
persons is so intense that a corporation may be said to think and act

through the person or the body of persons.

(ii) If the company is not impleaded as an accused its Managing
Director or any other Official cannot be made vicariously liable for

the acts committed by the company

(iii) If on a reading of uncontroverted facts no offence is made out a

complaint or proceeding can be quashed.

[47] It now needs to be seen as to what is the nature of allegations

against the petitioners.

[48] The petitioners 1, 2 and 3 in Criminal Petition No. 192/2016 are

the Directors of Meghalaya Cements Ltd, a company registered under the

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 20 of 26
Companies Act, 1956 and the petitioner No. 4 is an employee of the said
Company. On the other hand, the petitioner in Criminal Petition No. 189/2016
is the Chairman of said Meghalaya Cements Ltd. On a reading of the
chargesheet, dated 27.3.2014, appended as Annexure 4 to this petition, the
allegation against the petitioners is that during the period of 2008-2011 some
officials of North Eastern Coal Fields, CIL, entered into criminal conspiracy with
Sri Kailash Chand Lohia, Director of Meghalaya Cements Ltd. to facilitate misuse
of coal supplied from NEC, CIL under subsidized rates as per National Coal
Distribution Policy of Govt. of India. As per the Fuel Supply Agreement, done
between NEC/CIL and Sri Kailash Chand Lohia for Meghalaya Cements Ltd, coal
to the tune of 38,000 metric tonnes per annum was allotted to the Unit.
Accordingly, the firm had lifted 70,413 metric tonnes of coal from NEC, CIL.But,
instead of transporting the said coal to Meghalaya Cements Ltd, the Director
diverted the said coal for use in M/s K.D. Coke, Jorabat. The coal was allotted
and lifted at the rate of Rs 3680/- per tonne and rate fixed under E-auction
wasRs 3851/-. The quantity of coal lifted by Meghalaya Cements Ltd would have
fetched an amount of Rs 15,50,25,136/- to the CIL it sold through e-auction

open market. Hence, wrongful loss was caused to CIL.

[49] As against the heading “Charge” in Annexure 4, an elaborate
factual allegations have been portrayed. Though there are enough incriminating
circumstances as to how the coal obtained at subsidized rate was misused for
purpose other than the purpose meant for Meghalaya Cements Ltd. it would be
sufficient for the purpose of present adjudication if some sets of allegations are

brought on record.

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 21 of 26
[50] One of the allegation is that during investigation it was revealed
that consignment of coal lifted from NEC, CIL had to be transported through
Taxation Check Gate, Byrnihat, Megahalaya. It was revealed that a total of 2956
numbers of trucks was shown to have crossed Byrnihat Check gate carrying coal
from NEC, CIL in the name of Meghalaya Cements Ltd to its factory premises
Topcem Cements. These movements of trucks were verified with the
Commissioner of Taxes, Meghalaya, Shillong with a request to verify whether
the alleged movement of 2956 numbers of trucks infact took place. The
Commissioner of Taxes in his communications to CBI informed that a total of
295 numbers of truck had crossed the Taxation Check Gate. The Superintendent
of Taxes, however, informed that a total of 278 numbers of truck had crossed
the check Gate during the period of 1/7/2008 to 31/03/2011. Again, as per the
information received from the Superintendent of Taxes, of the total 278 trucks
not all the trucks had transported coal, rather; some of the trucks had
transported Fly Ash, Coke, LPG etc though the road permits show that coal was
transported. The Investigating Agency, thus, infers that if one truck can transport
23 MT coal, then 295 trucks could transport only 6785 MT of coal, thereby

showing, that 63,628 MT coal was diverted by Meghalaya Cements Ltd.

[51] The other allegation is that Office Stamp of Taxation Check Gate,
the Seal impression of Taxation Inspector appearing on the Road Challan,
Permits, Transport Documents of the Meghalaya Cements Ltd. transporting the

coal, were fake stamp and fake stamp signatures.

[52] These two sets of allegations, among a host of other allegations
are quite incriminating in nature. In State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal, reported in

1992 Supp (1) SCC 335, certain circumstances were laid down by the Hon’ble

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 22 of 26
Supreme Court when a complaint/FIR can be quashed. Those circumstances are

as follows:

(i) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the
complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in
their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a

case against the accused.

(ii) Where the allegations in the first information report and other
materials, if any, accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable
offence, justifying an investigation by police officers under Section
156(1) of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the

purview of Section 155(2) of the Code.

(iii) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or
complaint and the evidence collected in support of the same do not
disclose the commission of any offence and make out a case against

the accused.

(iv) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable
offence but constitute only a non-cognizable offence, no investigation
is permitted by a police officer without an order of a Magistrate as

contemplated under Section 155(2) of the Code.

(v) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd
and inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person
can ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for

proceeding against the accused.

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 23 of 26
(vi) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the
provisions of the Code or the concerned Act (under which a criminal
proceeding is instituted) to the institution and continuance of the
proceedings and/or where there is a specific provision in the Code or
the concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for the grievance of

the aggrieved party.

(vii) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala
fide and/or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an
ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a

view to spite him due to private and personal grudge.

[53] Applying the test laid down in the case of Bhajan Lal (supra) it
cannot be said, in the context of present case, that even uncontroverted
allegations do not make out any case. As there are strong prima facie materials
of tax evasion, cheating, and forgery, on facts, no case is made out for quashing

the proceedings.

[54] There is yet another aspect on which arguments have been
advanced and which needs appreciation. It is the contention of petitioners,
particularly in Criminal Petition No. 192/2016, that petitioner No. 4 Sri
Girdharilal Bathwal is only a Manager (Stores) and that he has been wrongly
implicated in this case. However, on perusal of charge sheet, Annexure 4, it is
found that petitioner No. 4, as Senior Manager (Stores), created false records of
receipt of coal consignments. | believe, embarking into any kind of inquiry to
ascertain the truthfulness of such allegations, at this stage, would be highly

prejudicial to the prosecution case. Hence, the argument has no force.

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 24 of 26
[55] As to the culpability of the petitioners, in both the cases, | may
point out certain observation of Courts in England, which have quoted with

approval in Iridium India (supra).

[56] In Director of Public Prosecutions v. Kent and Sussex Contractors
Lid. reported in (1944) 1 All ER 119 (DC) it was held that a body corporate is a
“person” to whom, amongst the various attributes it may have, there should be
imputed the attribute of a mind capable of knowing and forming an intention —
indeed it is much too late in the day to suggest the contrary. It can only know or
form an intention through its human agents, but circumstances may be such that

the knowledge of the agent must be imputed to the body corporate.

[57] Lord Denning in Bolton (H.L.) (Engg.) Co. Lid. v. T.J. Graham &
Sons Lid. reported in (1957) 1 QB 159 summarized his findings in the following

words:

A company may in many ways be likened to a human body. They have a
brain and a nerve centre which controls what they do. They also have
hands which hold the tools and act in accordance with directions from
the centre. Some of the people in the company are mere servants and
agents who are nothing more than hands to do the work and cannot be
said to represent the mind or will. Others are directors and managers
who represent the directing mind and will of the company, and control
what they do. The state of mind of these managers is the state of mind of
the company and Is treated by the law as such. $0 you will find that in
cases where the law requires personal fault as a condition of liability in
tort, the fault of the manager will be the personal fault of the company.

That is made clear in Lord Haldane’s speech in Lennard’s Carrying Co.

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 25 of 26
Ltd. v. Asiatic Petroleurn Co. Ltd. So also in the criminal law, in cases
where the law requires a guilty mind as a condition of a criminal offence,
the guilty mind of the directors or the managers will render the company

themselves guilty.

[58] The petitioners being directly involved in the affairs of Meghalaya
Cements Ltd, and admittedly holding positions like Chairman and Directors of
the Company cannot get any reprieve by way of an application under Section
482 Cr.PC because of the nature of materials unearthed during investigation. It
would, thus, not be proper to invoke the jurisdiction vested in this Court under
Section 482 Cr.PC and quash the proceedings of GR 854/2014 pending in the

Court of Special Judicial Magistrate, Assam, Guwahati.

[59] Lastly, an argument has been made with reference to the order in
WP (C) 243/12 of this Court in order to show that dispute is civil in nature.
However, in view of the incriminating materials, already discussed hereinbefore,
this Court is not inclined to go into deeper aspects of the merits of defence. The
petitioners will be able to take all such defences as would be available to them

under law when the trial proceeds.

[60] In the result, the petitions are dismissed. The interim order passed

earlier stands vacated.

heard and reserved for verdict. [3] The amendments, sought to be introduced in Criminal Petition
No. [4] The amendments, sought for, can be precisely stated as follows:

L. The Case No. in the original application was mentioned as CR

854/2016 which has been amended as GR 854/2016

ii. Accordingly, the firm had lifted 70,413 metric tonnes of coal from
NEC, CIL but instead of transporting the said coal to Meghalaya Cements Ltd the
Director diverted the said coal for use in M/s K.D. Coke, Jorabat. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 4 of 26
[8] As against the Closure Report, under Section 173 CrPC, the
impugned order, dated 4.8.12, was passed by learned Special Judge, Assam,
Guwahati, holding that since many aspects were left out during investigation the
Closure report cannot be accepted, and thereafter, the learned Special Judge
ordered re-investigation to be conducted by S$.P, CBI/ACB and to entrust a
competent officer other than Mr. R.C. Basumatary, to investigate the case and

submit report in final form. [9] In the investigation that ensued thereafter, the impugned
chargesheet, Annexure 4, was laid against the petitioners in both the cases. [13] The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners has placed reliance
on the cases of Vinay Tyagi v. Irshad Ali, reported in (2013) 5 SCC 762, Anju
Chaudhary v. State of U.P., reported in (2013) 6 SCC 384, Rama Chaudhary v.
State of Bihar, reported in (2009) 6 SCC 346, Chandra Babu v. State, reported in
(2015) 8 SCC 774, and State of Orissa v. Mahima, reported in (2007) 15 SCC

580. As
against the order of the Orissa High Court, the State preferred an appeal. In the
context of the factual scenario, the Hon’ble Supreme Court re-iterated the law
laid down in Hemant Dhasmana vs CBI, reported in (2001) 7 SCC 536 holding
that power of police to conduct further investigation in terms of Section 173 (8)

Cr. [15] In Rama Chaudhary (supra), the police after investigation had laid
a charge sheet against the accused persons. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 6 of 26
Investigating Agency had mentioned the name of 8 new witnesses. The prayer of
the prosecution to examine those witnesses was allowed by the Sessions Judge. Aggrieved by the order of Sessions Judge, the accused preferred a Criminal
Revision before the Hon’ble High Court of Patna. The material collected in further investigation

cannot be rejected only because it has been filed at the stage of the trial. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 7 of 26
(i) Whether in exercise of its powers under Section 173 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short “the Code”), the trial court
has the jurisdiction to ignore any one of the reports, where there are
two reports by the same or different investigating agencies in

furtherance of the orders of a court? [19] The “initial investigation” is the one which the empowered police
officer shall conduct in furtherance of registration of an FIR. It is
the continuation of previous investigation, and therefore, is understood and
described as “further investigation”. This is a kind of continuation of the previous investigation. The basis is
discovery of fresh evidence and in continuation of the same offence and chain of
events relating to the same occurrence incidental thereto. In other words, it has
to be understood in complete contradistinction to a “reinvestigation”, “fresh” or

“de novo” investigation. [21] However, in the case of a “fresh investigation”, “reinvestigation”
or “de novo investigation” there has to be a definite order of the court. The
order of the court unambiguously should state as to whether the previous
investigation, for reasons to be recorded, is incapable of being acted upon. Neither the investigating agency nor the Magistrate has any power to order or
conduct “fresh investigation”. This is primarily for the reason that it would be

opposed to the scheme of the Code. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 9 of 26
“fresh”/“de novo” investigation passed by the higher judiciary should always be
coupled with a specific direction as to the fate of the investigation already
conducted. The cases where such direction can be issued are few and far
between. This principle flows from the constitutional
mandate contained in Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution of India. The Supreme Court
eventually held that under the Code of Criminal Procedure a Magistrate has

power to order further investigation but not reinvestigation. [23] In view of the cases relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel, |
believe, it is not in dispute that once the Magistrate receives a report under
Section 173 CrPC on completion of investigation, ordering further investigation

is one of the courses open to the Magistrate. [24] | may recall here the case of Abhinandan Jha v. Dinesh Mishra,
reported in (AIR 1968 SC 117) wherein the Supreme Court had the occasion to

deal with the question as to what is the position, when the Magistrate is dealing

Criminal Petition No. That is, if the Magistrate feels,
after considering the final report, that the investigation is unsatisfactory, or
incomplete, or that there is scope for further investigation, it will be open to the
Magistrate to decline to accept the final report and direct the police to make
further investigation, under Section 156(3). The police, after such further
investigation, may submit a charge-sheet, or, again submit a final report,
depending upon the further investigation made by them. It may be that in a given situation a superior court in
exercise of its constitutional power, namely, under Articles 226 and 32 of the
Constitution of India could direct a “State” to get an offence investigated and/or
further investigated by a different agency. A distinction, therefore, exists between a reinvestigation and further

investigation. The meaning of “further” is additional, more, or supplemental. “Further” investigation, therefore, is the continuation of the earlier
investigation and not a fresh investigation or reinvestigation to be

started ab initio wiping out the earlier investigation altogether. Direction of a reinvestigation, however, being forbidden in law, no
superior court would ordinarily issue such a direction. Once such further investigation is ordered a
fresh investigation can be conducted and a new report can be filed and there
appears no hindrance in law that new opinion cannot be given. [31] In the present case so far as the order of the learned Special Judge
is concerned he had ordered a re-investigation by the CBI and by a different
Officer. But, the question which needs to be determined

here is whether by the impugned order a re-investigation has been conducted? [33] The first test of re-investigation is that a fresh investigation
should, ordinarily, be conducted by an agency other than the one which has
already conducted investigation. The second aspect of re-investigation is

observation regarding previous mala fide investigation. [35] Thus, the order of the learned Special Judge, cannot be assailed

on this ground. When the matter was
challenged in Hon’ble Supreme Court, by Iridium India, one of the grounds
taken by them was that the respondent Company cannot hide behind the
defence that the Company is incapable of possessing the necessary mens rea for
commission of the offence of cheating. The criminal liability of a corporation would arise when an offence is
committed in relation to the business of the corporation by a person or body of
persons in control of its affairs. Mens rea is attributed to corporations on the principle of

“alter ego” of the company. supra), is

reproduced as follows;

[38]

63... it becomes evident that a corporation is virtually in the
same position as any individual and may be convicted of
common law as well as statutory offences including those
requiring mens rea. In such circumstances, it would be necessary to ascertain
that the degree and control of the person or body of persons is so
intense that a corporation may be said to think and act through
the person or the body of persons. The position of law on this
issue in Canada is almost the same. However, when the matter was taken up for the cognizance, the Special
Judge held that Mr Sunil Bharti Mittal was Chairman-cum-Managing Director of
Bharti Cellular Ltd., Mr. Asim Ghosh was Managing Director of Hutchison Max
Telecom (P) Ltd. and Mr Ravi Ruia was a Director in Sterling Cellular Ltd., who
used to chair the meetings of its Board. According to him, in that capacity, these
persons, prima facie, could be treated as controlling the affairs of the respective
companies and represent the directing mind and will of each company. [41] On the facts of the case in Sunil Bharti Mittal (supra) itself it can
be said that this case may not be of any assistance to decide the present subject
matter as it is not the case of the petitioners that without they being named in
the charge sheet, processes have been issued against them without recording a
prima facie observation regarding their liability. If and when a é statute
contemplates creation of such a legal fiction, it provides specifically therefor. In
absence of any provision laid down under the statute, a Director of a Company
Or an employee cannot be held to be vicariously liable for any offence

committed by the Company itself. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 19 of 26
accused its Managing Director was impleaded as accused on the principles of
vicarious liability. [47] It now needs to be seen as to what is the nature of allegations

against the petitioners. 192/2016 are

the Directors of Meghalaya Cements Ltd, a company registered under the

Criminal Petition No. 189/2016
is the Chairman of said Meghalaya Cements Ltd. On a reading of the
chargesheet, dated 27.3.2014, appended as Annexure 4 to this petition, the
allegation against the petitioners is that during the period of 2008-2011 some
officials of North Eastern Coal Fields, CIL, entered into criminal conspiracy with
Sri Kailash Chand Lohia, Director of Meghalaya Cements Ltd. to facilitate misuse
of coal supplied from NEC, CIL under subsidized rates as per National Coal
Distribution Policy of Govt. As per the Fuel Supply Agreement, done
between NEC/CIL and Sri Kailash Chand Lohia for Meghalaya Cements Ltd, coal
to the tune of 38,000 metric tonnes per annum was allotted to the Unit. The coal was allotted
and lifted at the rate of Rs 3680/- per tonne and rate fixed under E-auction
wasRs 3851/-. The quantity of coal lifted by Meghalaya Cements Ltd would have
fetched an amount of Rs 15,50,25,136/- to the CIL it sold through e-auction

open market. [49] As against the heading “Charge” in Annexure 4, an elaborate
factual allegations have been portrayed. Though there are enough incriminating
circumstances as to how the coal obtained at subsidized rate was misused for
purpose other than the purpose meant for Meghalaya Cements Ltd. it would be
sufficient for the purpose of present adjudication if some sets of allegations are

brought on record. The
Commissioner of Taxes in his communications to CBI informed that a total of
295 numbers of truck had crossed the Taxation Check Gate. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 22 of 26
Supreme Court when a complaint/FIR can be quashed. Those circumstances are

as follows:

(i) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the
complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in
their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a

case against the accused. (ii) Where the allegations in the first information report and other
materials, if any, accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable
offence, justifying an investigation by police officers under Section
156(1) of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the

purview of Section 155(2) of the Code. (vii) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala
fide and/or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an
ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a

view to spite him due to private and personal grudge. [54] There is yet another aspect on which arguments have been
advanced and which needs appreciation. It is the contention of petitioners,
particularly in Criminal Petition No. However, on perusal of charge sheet, Annexure 4, it is
found that petitioner No. 4, as Senior Manager (Stores), created false records of
receipt of coal consignments. | believe, embarking into any kind of inquiry to
ascertain the truthfulness of such allegations, at this stage, would be highly

prejudicial to the prosecution case. [56] In Director of Public Prosecutions v. Kent and Sussex Contractors
Lid. reported in (1957) 1 QB 159 summarized his findings in the following

words:

A company may in many ways be likened to a human body. They have a
brain and a nerve centre which controls what they do. They also have
hands which hold the tools and act in accordance with directions from
the centre. Others are directors and managers
who represent the directing mind and will of the company, and control
what they do. The state of mind of these managers is the state of mind of
the company and Is treated by the law as such. That is made clear in Lord Haldane’s speech in Lennard’s Carrying Co.

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 25 of 26
Ltd. v. Asiatic Petroleurn Co. Ltd. So also in the criminal law, in cases
where the law requires a guilty mind as a condition of a criminal offence,
the guilty mind of the directors or the managers will render the company

themselves guilty. PC because of the nature of materials unearthed during investigation. It
would, thus, not be proper to invoke the jurisdiction vested in this Court under
Section 482 Cr.","IN THE GAUHATI HIGH COURT

JUDGMENT & ORDER (CAV)

By way of this common judgment and order, | propose to
dispose of the Criminal Petition No. 189/2016 and Criminal Petition No.

192/2016 preferred under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

[2] It may be mentioned at the outset that both these cases were
heard and reserved for verdict. However, certain discrepancy was noticed in the
nomenclature of the case, sought to be quashed, hence the discrepancy was

brought to the notice of learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners. The learned

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 2 of 26
Senior Counsel for the petitioners, having realized the error, sought to file a
correction/modification application and accordingly vide |.A (Crl) No. 603/2017
in Criminal Petition No. 189/2016 and 1.A (Crl) No. 608/2017 in Criminal

Petition No. 192/2016 amendments were sought to be introduced.

[3] The amendments, sought to be introduced in Criminal Petition
No. 189/2016 and Criminal Petition No. 192/2016, were heard on 24.08.2017
and after considering that the proposed amendments are only clarificatory in
nature, prayers in both the Interlocutory Applications were allowed. The
amendments in Criminal Petition No. 189/2016 and Criminal Petition No.

192/2016 shall now be read as part of original petitions.

[4] The amendments, sought for, can be precisely stated as follows:

L. The Case No. in the original application was mentioned as CR

854/2016 which has been amended as GR 854/2016

ii. In the cause title as well as in the body of the petition it was
stated that the case is presently pending in the Court of learned
Chief Judicial Magistrate, Kamrup (Metro), Guwahati which
has, now, been corrected as learned Special Judicial Magistrate,

Assam, Guwahati

[5] Having dealt with the clarificatory aspects of the case | now

proceed to decide the case as follows;

[6] The petitioners 1, 2 and 3 in Criminal Petition No. 192/2016 are
the Directors of Meghalaya Cements Ltd, a company registered under the
Companies Act, 1956 and the petitioner No. 4 is an employee of the said

Company. On the other hand, the petitioner in Criminal Petition No. 189/2016

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 3 of 26
is the Chairman of said Meghalaya Cements Ltd. On a reading of the chargesheet
dated 27.3.2014, appended as Annexure 4 to this petition, the allegation against
the petitioners is that during the period of 2008-2011 some officials of North
Eastern Coal Fields, CIL, (hereinafter referred to NEC, CIL) entered into criminal
conspiracy with Sri Kailash Chand Lohia, Director of Meghalaya Cements Ltd. to
facilitate misuse of coal supplied from NEC, CIL under subsidized rates as per
National Coal Distribution Policy of Govt. of India. As per the Fuel Supply
Agreement done between NEC/CIL and Sri Kailash Chand Lohia for Meghalaya
Cements Ltd, coal to the tune of 38,000 metric tonnes per annum was allotted
to the Unit. Accordingly, the firm had lifted 70,413 metric tonnes of coal from
NEC, CIL but instead of transporting the said coal to Meghalaya Cements Ltd the
Director diverted the said coal for use in M/s K.D. Coke, Jorabat. The coal was
allotted and lifted at the rate of Rs 3680/- per tonne and rate fixed under Eauction is Rs 3851. The quantity of coal lifted by Meghalaya Cements Ltd would
have fetched an amount of Rs 15,50,25,136/- to the CIL if sold through e-auction
open market. Hence, wrongful loss was caused to CIL. Apart from the
allegations of cheating there are some other allegations that the petitioners
having entered into conspiracy created forged documents and used those
documents for the purpose of cheating. A chargesheet, thus, for the offences
under Section 420/468 read with Section 120B IPC has been laid against the

petitioners in both the cases.

[7] An FIR was lodged in this regard by Mr. H.C. Nath, IPS, Head of
Branch, CBI/ACB/Guwahati on 12.4.2011. The FIR was investigated, and after

investigation, a closure report, under Section 173 CrPC, was laid on 27.6.2012.

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 4 of 26
[8] As against the Closure Report, under Section 173 CrPC, the
impugned order, dated 4.8.12, was passed by learned Special Judge, Assam,
Guwahati, holding that since many aspects were left out during investigation the
Closure report cannot be accepted, and thereafter, the learned Special Judge
ordered re-investigation to be conducted by S$.P, CBI/ACB and to entrust a
competent officer other than Mr. R.C. Basumatary, to investigate the case and

submit report in final form.

[9] In the investigation that ensued thereafter, the impugned
chargesheet, Annexure 4, was laid against the petitioners in both the cases. Since
no materials against any public servants were found, the charges under the
Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, were dropped and hence, the chargesheet
was submitted in the Court of Special Judicial Magistrate, Assam, Guwahati, for
offences under Section 120B/420/409 IPC against the petitioners in both the

cases.

[10] Heard Mr. Diganta Das, learned Senior Counsel, appearing for
the petitioners in both the cases and also Mr. S.C. Keyal, learned Standing

Counsel, CBI.

[11] In the course of arguments, Mr. Das, learned Senior Counsel for

the petitioners laid emphasis on three aspects of law:

Firstly, the learned Special Judge could not have ordered re-investigation
of the case as re-investigation means fresh investigation, and hence, could

not have been so ordered

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 5 of 26
Secondly, for the offence committed by Company, if any, no vicarious
liability can be attached to the petitioners being Chairman, Directors and

employee of the Company

Thirdly, that, even if the allegations are taken on its face value yet no

offence is made out, and therefore, the chargesheet needs to be quashed.

[12] On the other hand, the learned Standing Counsel, CBI argued
that it is within the ambit of a Court sitting on a report under Section 173 CrPC

to reject the report an order further investigation.

[13] The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners has placed reliance
on the cases of Vinay Tyagi v. Irshad Ali, reported in (2013) 5 SCC 762, Anju
Chaudhary v. State of U.P., reported in (2013) 6 SCC 384, Rama Chaudhary v.
State of Bihar, reported in (2009) 6 SCC 346, Chandra Babu v. State, reported in
(2015) 8 SCC 774, and State of Orissa v. Mahima, reported in (2007) 15 SCC

580.

[14] In Mahima (supra), the Orissa High Court had quashed a further
investigation done by the Crime Branch on the ground of abuse of process. As
against the order of the Orissa High Court, the State preferred an appeal. In the
context of the factual scenario, the Hon’ble Supreme Court re-iterated the law
laid down in Hemant Dhasmana vs CBI, reported in (2001) 7 SCC 536 holding
that power of police to conduct further investigation in terms of Section 173 (8)

Cr.PC is unfettered.

[15] In Rama Chaudhary (supra), the police after investigation had laid
a charge sheet against the accused persons. In the course of trial, a

supplementary charge sheet was laid against the accused person, wherein the

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 6 of 26
Investigating Agency had mentioned the name of 8 new witnesses. The prayer of
the prosecution to examine those witnesses was allowed by the Sessions Judge.
Aggrieved by the order of Sessions Judge, the accused preferred a Criminal
Revision before the Hon’ble High Court of Patna.The order of Sessions Judge
was upheld by the Hon’ble High Court. As against the order of High Court, the
accused approached the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court, while upholding
the order of High Court as well as the Court of Session, held that it is settled law
that carrying out further investigation, even after filing of the charge-sheet, is a
statutory right of the police. The material collected in further investigation

cannot be rejected only because it has been filed at the stage of the trial.

[16] The other relevant observation of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in
Rama Chaudhary (supra), was that the police has a right to “further”
investigation under sub-section (8) of Section 173 but not “fresh investigation” or
“reinvestigation”. The meaning of “further” is additional, more, or
supplemental. “Further” investigation, therefore, is the continuation of the
earlier investigation and not a fresh investigation or reinvestigation to be started
ab initio wiping out the earlier investigation altogether. It further held that Subsection (8) of Section 173 clearly envisages that on completion of further
investigation, the investigating agency has to forward to the Magistrate a
“further” report and not a fresh report regarding the “further” evidence

obtained during such investigation.

[17] In Vinay Tyagi v. Irshad Ali, reported in (2013) 5 SCC 762, as
relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners, the following

questions came up for consideration before the Supreme Court:

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 7 of 26
(i) Whether in exercise of its powers under Section 173 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short “the Code”), the trial court
has the jurisdiction to ignore any one of the reports, where there are
two reports by the same or different investigating agencies in

furtherance of the orders of a court? If so, to what effect?

(ii) Whether the Central Bureau of Investigation (for short “CBI”) is
empowered to conduct “fresh”/ “reinvestigation” when the
cognizance has already been taken by the court of competent
jurisdiction on the basis of a police report under Section 173 of the

Code?

[18] In the course of deliberations, the Hon’ble Supreme Court in
Vinay Tyagi v. Irshad Ali, reported in (2013) 5 SCC 762, held that investigation

can be of the following kinds:
(i) Initial investigation,
(ii) Further investigation,
(iii) Fresh or de novo or reinvestigation.

[19] The “initial investigation” is the one which the empowered police
officer shall conduct in furtherance of registration of an FIR. Such investigation
itself can lead to filing of a final report under Section 173(2) of the Code and
shall take within its ambit the investigation which the empowered officer shall
conduct in furtherance of an order for investigation passed by the court of

competent jurisdiction in terms of Section 156(3) of the Code.

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 8 of 26
[20] “Further investigation” is where the investigating officer obtains
further oral or documentary evidence after the final report has been filed before
the court in terms of Section 173(8). This power is vested with the executive. It is
the continuation of previous investigation, and therefore, is understood and
described as “further investigation”. The scope of such investigation is restricted
to the discovery of further oral and documentary evidence. Its purpose is to
bring the true facts before the court even if they are discovered at a subsequent
stage to the primary investigation. It is commonly described as “supplementary
report”. “Supplementary report” would be the correct expression as the
subsequent investigation is meant and intended to supplement the primary
investigation conducted by the empowered police officer. Another significant
feature of further investigation is that it does not have the effect of wiping out,
directly or impliedly, the initial investigation conducted by the investigating
agency. This is a kind of continuation of the previous investigation. The basis is
discovery of fresh evidence and in continuation of the same offence and chain of
events relating to the same occurrence incidental thereto. In other words, it has
to be understood in complete contradistinction to a “reinvestigation”, “fresh” or

“de novo” investigation.

[21] However, in the case of a “fresh investigation”, “reinvestigation”
or “de novo investigation” there has to be a definite order of the court. The
order of the court unambiguously should state as to whether the previous
investigation, for reasons to be recorded, is incapable of being acted upon.
Neither the investigating agency nor the Magistrate has any power to order or
conduct “fresh investigation”. This is primarily for the reason that it would be

opposed to the scheme of the Code. It is essential that even an order of

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 9 of 26
“fresh”/“de novo” investigation passed by the higher judiciary should always be
coupled with a specific direction as to the fate of the investigation already
conducted. The cases where such direction can be issued are few and far
between. This is based upon a fundamental principle of our criminal
jurisprudence which is that it is the right of a suspect or an accused to have a just
and fair investigation and trial. This principle flows from the constitutional
mandate contained in Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution of India. Where the
investigation ex facie is unfair, tainted, mala fide and smacks of foul play, the
courts would set aside such an investigation and direct fresh or de novo
investigation and, if necessary, even by another independent investigating

agency.

[22] In Chandra Babu v. State, reported in (2015) 8 SCC 774, also
relied upon by the learned Standing Counsel, CBI, again an occasion arose
before the Hon’ble Supreme Court regarding the powers of Magistrate to pass
orders on further investigation and re-investigation. The Supreme Court
eventually held that under the Code of Criminal Procedure a Magistrate has

power to order further investigation but not reinvestigation.

[23] In view of the cases relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel, |
believe, it is not in dispute that once the Magistrate receives a report under
Section 173 CrPC on completion of investigation, ordering further investigation

is one of the courses open to the Magistrate.

[24] | may recall here the case of Abhinandan Jha v. Dinesh Mishra,
reported in (AIR 1968 SC 117) wherein the Supreme Court had the occasion to

deal with the question as to what is the position, when the Magistrate is dealing

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 10 of 26
with a report submitted by the police, under Section 173, that no case is made

out for sending up an accused for trial, which report is called as a ‘final report’?

[25] It was held in Abhinandan Jha (supra), that even in those cases, if
the Magistrate agrees with the said report, he may accept the final report and
close the proceedings. But there may be instances when the Magistrate may take
the view, on a consideration of the final report, that the opinion formed by the
police is not based on a full and complete investigation in which case the
Magistrate will have ample jurisdiction to give directions to the police, under
Section 156(3), to make a further investigation. That is, if the Magistrate feels,
after considering the final report, that the investigation is unsatisfactory, or
incomplete, or that there is scope for further investigation, it will be open to the
Magistrate to decline to accept the final report and direct the police to make
further investigation, under Section 156(3). The police, after such further
investigation, may submit a charge-sheet, or, again submit a final report,
depending upon the further investigation made by them. If, ultimately, the
Magistrate forms the opinion that the facts, set out in the final report, constitute
an offence, he can take cognizance of the offence, under Section 190(1)(b),

notwithstanding the contrary opinion of the police, expressed in the final report.

[26] Now, when the report, forwarded, under Clause (i) of SubSection (2) of Section 173, by the officer-in-charge of a police station to the
Magistrate, comes up for consideration by the Magistrate, one of two different
situations may, as pointed out in Bhagwant Singh v. Commr. of Police, reported
in (1985) 2 SCC 537 may arise. The report may conclude that an offence appears
to have been committed by a particular person or persons and, in such a case,

the Magistrate may do one of three things: (i) he may accept the report and take

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 11 of 26
‘cognizance’ of the offence or offences, as the case may be, and issue process or
(ii) he may disagree with the report and drop the proceeding or (iii) he may
direct 'further investigation’ under sub-section (3) of Section 156 and require the

police to submit a further report.

[27] In the case of Mithabhai Pashabhai Patel v. State of Gujarat,
reported in (2009) 6 SCC 332, the Hon’ble Supreme Court held that it is,
however, beyond any cavil that “further investigation” and “reinvestigation”
stand on different footing. It may be that in a given situation a superior court in
exercise of its constitutional power, namely, under Articles 226 and 32 of the
Constitution of India could direct a “State” to get an offence investigated and/or
further investigated by a different agency. Direction of a_ reinvestigation,
however, being forbidden in law, no superior court would ordinarily issue such
a direction. A distinction, therefore, exists between a reinvestigation and further

investigation.

[28] The relevant observations of Hon’ble Supreme Court, in

Mithabhai Pashabhai Patel (supra), are reproduced as follows:

“13. It is, however, beyond any cavil that “further investigation”
and “reinvestigation” stand on different footing. It may be that in
a given situation a superior court in exercise of its constitutional
power, namely, under Articles 226 and 32 of the Constitution of
India could direct a “State” to get an offence investigated and/or
further investigated by a different agency. Direction of a
reinvestigation, however, being forbidden in law, no superior

court would ordinarily issue such a direction.”

[29] The discussions, made above, may be summarized in the

following manner:

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 12 of 26
(i) That, police has a right to “further” investigation under sub-section
(8) of Section 173 but not “fresh investigation” or “reinvestigation”.
The meaning of “further” is additional, more, or supplemental.
“Further” investigation, therefore, is the continuation of the earlier
investigation and not a fresh investigation or reinvestigation to be

started ab initio wiping out the earlier investigation altogether.

(ii) In the case of a “fresh investigation”, “reinvestigation” or “de
novo investigation” there has to be a definite order of the court. The
order of the court unambiguously should state as to whether the
previous investigation, for reasons to be recorded, is incapable of
being acted upon. Neither the investigating agency nor the
Magistrate has any power to order or conduct “fresh investigation”.
It is essential that even an order of “fresh”/“de novo” investigation
passed by the higher judiciary should always be coupled with a
specific direction as to the fate of the investigation already

conducted.

(iii) If the Magistrate feels, after considering the final report, that the
investigation is unsatisfactory, or incomplete, or that there is scope
for further investigation, it will be open to the Magistrate to decline
to accept the final report and direct the police to make further
investigation, under Section 156(3). The police, after such further
investigation, may submit a charge-sheet, or, again submit a final

report, depending upon the further investigation made by them.

(iv) If in a given situation a superior court in exercise of its

constitutional power, namely, under Articles 226 and 32 of the

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 13 of 26
Constitution of India directs a “State” to get an offence investigated
and/or further investigated by a different agency wiping out previous
investigation such investigation would be called re-investigation.
Direction of a reinvestigation, however, being forbidden in law, no
superior court would ordinarily issue such a direction. A distinction,

therefore, exists between a reinvestigation and further investigation

[30] Thus, in the light of the cases, discussed hereinbefore, what
emerges is that if the Investigating Agency, after conducting investigation, lays a
charge sheet against the accused persons upon which Magistrate takes cognizance
and trial proceeds, what is permissible for the Police is to submit only additional
and further reports u/s 173 (8) Cr.PC and not a new and fresh report. However,
the said scenario cannot be conceived of in a situation where the Magistrate is
ordering further investigation in exercise of powers u/s 156(3) CrPC by rejecting
the opinion of Investigating Officer. Once such further investigation is ordered a
fresh investigation can be conducted and a new report can be filed and there
appears no hindrance in law that new opinion cannot be given. If it is argued
that even after ordering further investigation the Investigating Agency must stick
to its previous opinion, then the very purpose of further investigation would be

rendered nugatory.

[31] In the present case so far as the order of the learned Special Judge
is concerned he had ordered a re-investigation by the CBI and by a different
Officer. Keeping aside the use of expression re-investigation in the context of the
order, | may point out that the practice of ordering that investigation shall be
carried out by a particular Officer also came up for discussion in Hemant

Dhasmana v. CBI, reported in (2001) 7 SCC 536, wherein the Supreme Court

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 14 of 26
held in clear terms that it is not within the province of the Magistrate while
exercising the power under Section 173(8) to specify any particular officer to
conduct such investigation, not even to suggest the rank of the officer who
should conduct such investigation. Hence, the order of the learned Special Judge,
that investigation should be conducted by an officer other that Mr. R.C.
Basumatary, was not proper though on this count the order would not stand

vitiated.

[32] Now, coming to the use of expression re-investigation indeed in
view of the law laid down it would not have been permissible for the Special
Judge, to order re-investigation. But, the question which needs to be determined

here is whether by the impugned order a re-investigation has been conducted?

[33] The first test of re-investigation is that a fresh investigation
should, ordinarily, be conducted by an agency other than the one which has
already conducted investigation. The second aspect of re-investigation is

observation regarding previous mala fide investigation.

[34] In the present case, the learned Special Judge has only ordered reinvestigation by CBI, the same agency that conducted the previous investigation.
Secondly, there is no observation regarding any mala fides on the part of the
investigating agency regarding previous investigation. Hence, even though the
expression used is re-investigation, infact, what the learned Special Judge meant
was further investigation. The use of expression re-investigation, in the context
of present case, has to be termed as misnomer or a legally inaccurate expression.
Thus, not much can be read and should be read into the expression re
investigation when otherwise only further investigation has been conducted in

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 15 of 26
terms of the power conferred by Section 156(3) CrPC which the learned Special

Judge possessed.

[35] Thus, the order of the learned Special Judge, cannot be assailed

on this ground.

[36] Now, coming to the other leg of arguments, made by the learned
Senior Counsel for the petitioners, about corporate criminal liability how far a
juristic person can be made criminally liable for offences remained an unsettled
issue till the case of /ridium India Telecom Ltd. v. Motorola Inc., reported in
(2011) 1 SCC 74. \n this case, Iridium India had filed a criminal complaint against
Motorola Inc. alleging commission of offence under Section 420/120B IPC. The
complaint was quashed by the Bombay High Court. When the matter was
challenged in Hon’ble Supreme Court, by Iridium India, one of the grounds
taken by them was that the respondent Company cannot hide behind the
defence that the Company is incapable of possessing the necessary mens rea for
commission of the offence of cheating. While answering the rival arguments
made on the point of criminal liability of a corporate body the Hon’ble Supreme
Court, in /ridium India Telecom Ltd. (supra), held in categorical terms that a
corporation is virtually in the same position as any individual and may be
convicted of common law as well as statutory offences including those requiring
mens rea. The criminal liability of a corporation would arise when an offence is
committed in relation to the business of the corporation by a person or body of
persons in control of its affairs. In such circumstances, it would be necessary to
ascertain that the degree and control of the person or body of persons is so

intense that a corporation may be said to think and act through the person or

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 16 of 26
the body of persons. Mens rea is attributed to corporations on the principle of

“alter ego” of the company.

[37]

The relevant paragraph in /ridium India Telecom Lid. (supra), is

reproduced as follows;

[38]

63... it becomes evident that a corporation is virtually in the
same position as any individual and may be convicted of
common law as well as statutory offences including those
requiring mens rea. The criminal liability of a corporation would
arise when an offence is committed in relation to the business of
the corporation by a person or body of persons in control of its
affairs. In such circumstances, it would be necessary to ascertain
that the degree and control of the person or body of persons is so
intense that a corporation may be said to think and act through
the person or the body of persons. The position of law on this
issue in Canada is almost the same. Mens rea is attributed to

corporations on the principle of “alter ego” of the company.

It was further held that a company/corporation cannot escape

liability for a criminal offence merely because the punishment prescribed is that

of imprisonment and fine.

[39]

The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners has referred to the

cases of Sunil Bharti Mittal vs CBI, reported in (2015) 4 SCC 609, Thermax

Limited vs K.M. Johny, reported in (2011) 13 SCC 412, Asoke Basak v. State of

Maharashtra, reported in (2010) 10 SCC 660, Maksud Saiyed vs State of Gujrat,

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 17 of 26
reported in (2008) 5 SCC 668, and S.K. Alagh vs State of U.P, reported in

(2008) 5 SCC 662.

[40] In Sunil Bharti Mittal (supra), a charge sheet was laid against 4
persons. However, when the matter was taken up for the cognizance, the Special
Judge held that Mr Sunil Bharti Mittal was Chairman-cum-Managing Director of
Bharti Cellular Ltd., Mr. Asim Ghosh was Managing Director of Hutchison Max
Telecom (P) Ltd. and Mr Ravi Ruia was a Director in Sterling Cellular Ltd., who
used to chair the meetings of its Board. According to him, in that capacity, these
persons, prima facie, could be treated as controlling the affairs of the respective
companies and represent the directing mind and will of each company. They
were, thus, “alter ego” of their respective companies and the acts of the
companies could be attributed and imputed to them. On this premise, the
Special Judge felt that there was enough material on record to proceed against
these three persons as well. Thus, while taking cognizance of the case, he
decided to issue summons not only to the four accused named in the charge
sheet but the aforesaid three persons as well.

[41] On the facts of the case in Sunil Bharti Mittal (supra) itself it can
be said that this case may not be of any assistance to decide the present subject
matter as it is not the case of the petitioners that without they being named in
the charge sheet, processes have been issued against them without recording a
prima facie observation regarding their liability. The admitted position is that

petitioners have been charge sheeted as accused in the case in hand.

[42] In any view of the matter, the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Sunil
Bharti Mittal (supra), elucidated the law laid down in /ridium India (supra), and

held that the legal proposition that is laid down in the aforesaid judgment in

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 18 of 26
Iridium India (supra) is that if the person or group of persons who control the
affairs of the company commit an offence with a criminal intent, their criminality

can be imputed to the company as well as they are “alter ego” of the company.

[43] The cases of Thermax Ltd. v. K.M. Johny, reported in (2011) 13
SCC 412, Asoke Basak v. State of Maharashtra, reported in (2010) 10 SCC 660,
Maksud Saiyed v. State of Gujarat, reported in (2008) 5 SCC 668 andAsoke
Basak v. State of Maharashtra, reported in (2010) 10 SCC 660 do not seem to
have deviated from the law laid down in /ridium India (supra), rather on factual
analysis the Hon’ble Supreme Court found that no case is made out. Whether in
the present case offence is made out against the petitioners is being discussed

hereinafter.

[44] In $.K. Alagh v. State of U.P., reported in (2008) 5 SCC 662, a
criminal complaint was filed against the Managing Director and the General
Manager of Britannia Industries Ltd for offence under Section 405 IPC. The
company itself was not made an accused. It was in these context the Hon’ble
Supreme Court had held that as, admittedly, drafts were drawn in the name of
the Company, the Managing Director, cannot be said to have committed an
offence under Section 406 of the Penal Code. If and when a é statute
contemplates creation of such a legal fiction, it provides specifically therefor. In
absence of any provision laid down under the statute, a Director of a Company
Or an employee cannot be held to be vicariously liable for any offence

committed by the Company itself.

[45] The ratio of $.K. Alagh (supra) is not found to be applicable in
the present case because in §$.K. Alagh (supra), it was the company which was

alleged to have committed the offence, but instead of making the company as

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 19 of 26
accused its Managing Director was impleaded as accused on the principles of
vicarious liability. However, in the present case company has been made accused
and the petitioners are alleged to be the directing mind and will of the company

as its Directors.

[46] What emerges from the discussion undertaken hereinbefore is as

follows:

(i) A corporation is virtually in the same position as any individual
and may be convicted of common law as well as statutory offences
including those requiring mens rea. The criminal liability of a
corporation would arise when an offence is committed in relation to
the business of the corporation by a person or body of persons in
control of its affairs. In such circumstances, it would be necessary to
ascertain that the degree and control of the person or body of
persons is so intense that a corporation may be said to think and act

through the person or the body of persons.

(ii) If the company is not impleaded as an accused its Managing
Director or any other Official cannot be made vicariously liable for

the acts committed by the company

(iii) If on a reading of uncontroverted facts no offence is made out a

complaint or proceeding can be quashed.

[47] It now needs to be seen as to what is the nature of allegations

against the petitioners.

[48] The petitioners 1, 2 and 3 in Criminal Petition No. 192/2016 are

the Directors of Meghalaya Cements Ltd, a company registered under the

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 20 of 26
Companies Act, 1956 and the petitioner No. 4 is an employee of the said
Company. On the other hand, the petitioner in Criminal Petition No. 189/2016
is the Chairman of said Meghalaya Cements Ltd. On a reading of the
chargesheet, dated 27.3.2014, appended as Annexure 4 to this petition, the
allegation against the petitioners is that during the period of 2008-2011 some
officials of North Eastern Coal Fields, CIL, entered into criminal conspiracy with
Sri Kailash Chand Lohia, Director of Meghalaya Cements Ltd. to facilitate misuse
of coal supplied from NEC, CIL under subsidized rates as per National Coal
Distribution Policy of Govt. of India. As per the Fuel Supply Agreement, done
between NEC/CIL and Sri Kailash Chand Lohia for Meghalaya Cements Ltd, coal
to the tune of 38,000 metric tonnes per annum was allotted to the Unit.
Accordingly, the firm had lifted 70,413 metric tonnes of coal from NEC, CIL.But,
instead of transporting the said coal to Meghalaya Cements Ltd, the Director
diverted the said coal for use in M/s K.D. Coke, Jorabat. The coal was allotted
and lifted at the rate of Rs 3680/- per tonne and rate fixed under E-auction
wasRs 3851/-. The quantity of coal lifted by Meghalaya Cements Ltd would have
fetched an amount of Rs 15,50,25,136/- to the CIL it sold through e-auction

open market. Hence, wrongful loss was caused to CIL.

[49] As against the heading “Charge” in Annexure 4, an elaborate
factual allegations have been portrayed. Though there are enough incriminating
circumstances as to how the coal obtained at subsidized rate was misused for
purpose other than the purpose meant for Meghalaya Cements Ltd. it would be
sufficient for the purpose of present adjudication if some sets of allegations are

brought on record.

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 21 of 26
[50] One of the allegation is that during investigation it was revealed
that consignment of coal lifted from NEC, CIL had to be transported through
Taxation Check Gate, Byrnihat, Megahalaya. It was revealed that a total of 2956
numbers of trucks was shown to have crossed Byrnihat Check gate carrying coal
from NEC, CIL in the name of Meghalaya Cements Ltd to its factory premises
Topcem Cements. These movements of trucks were verified with the
Commissioner of Taxes, Meghalaya, Shillong with a request to verify whether
the alleged movement of 2956 numbers of trucks infact took place. The
Commissioner of Taxes in his communications to CBI informed that a total of
295 numbers of truck had crossed the Taxation Check Gate. The Superintendent
of Taxes, however, informed that a total of 278 numbers of truck had crossed
the check Gate during the period of 1/7/2008 to 31/03/2011. Again, as per the
information received from the Superintendent of Taxes, of the total 278 trucks
not all the trucks had transported coal, rather; some of the trucks had
transported Fly Ash, Coke, LPG etc though the road permits show that coal was
transported. The Investigating Agency, thus, infers that if one truck can transport
23 MT coal, then 295 trucks could transport only 6785 MT of coal, thereby

showing, that 63,628 MT coal was diverted by Meghalaya Cements Ltd.

[51] The other allegation is that Office Stamp of Taxation Check Gate,
the Seal impression of Taxation Inspector appearing on the Road Challan,
Permits, Transport Documents of the Meghalaya Cements Ltd. transporting the

coal, were fake stamp and fake stamp signatures.

[52] These two sets of allegations, among a host of other allegations
are quite incriminating in nature. In State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal, reported in

1992 Supp (1) SCC 335, certain circumstances were laid down by the Hon’ble

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 22 of 26
Supreme Court when a complaint/FIR can be quashed. Those circumstances are

as follows:

(i) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the
complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in
their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a

case against the accused.

(ii) Where the allegations in the first information report and other
materials, if any, accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable
offence, justifying an investigation by police officers under Section
156(1) of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the

purview of Section 155(2) of the Code.

(iii) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or
complaint and the evidence collected in support of the same do not
disclose the commission of any offence and make out a case against

the accused.

(iv) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable
offence but constitute only a non-cognizable offence, no investigation
is permitted by a police officer without an order of a Magistrate as

contemplated under Section 155(2) of the Code.

(v) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd
and inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person
can ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for

proceeding against the accused.

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 23 of 26
(vi) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the
provisions of the Code or the concerned Act (under which a criminal
proceeding is instituted) to the institution and continuance of the
proceedings and/or where there is a specific provision in the Code or
the concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for the grievance of

the aggrieved party.

(vii) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala
fide and/or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an
ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a

view to spite him due to private and personal grudge.

[53] Applying the test laid down in the case of Bhajan Lal (supra) it
cannot be said, in the context of present case, that even uncontroverted
allegations do not make out any case. As there are strong prima facie materials
of tax evasion, cheating, and forgery, on facts, no case is made out for quashing

the proceedings.

[54] There is yet another aspect on which arguments have been
advanced and which needs appreciation. It is the contention of petitioners,
particularly in Criminal Petition No. 192/2016, that petitioner No. 4 Sri
Girdharilal Bathwal is only a Manager (Stores) and that he has been wrongly
implicated in this case. However, on perusal of charge sheet, Annexure 4, it is
found that petitioner No. 4, as Senior Manager (Stores), created false records of
receipt of coal consignments. | believe, embarking into any kind of inquiry to
ascertain the truthfulness of such allegations, at this stage, would be highly

prejudicial to the prosecution case. Hence, the argument has no force.

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 24 of 26
[55] As to the culpability of the petitioners, in both the cases, | may
point out certain observation of Courts in England, which have quoted with

approval in Iridium India (supra).

[56] In Director of Public Prosecutions v. Kent and Sussex Contractors
Lid. reported in (1944) 1 All ER 119 (DC) it was held that a body corporate is a
“person” to whom, amongst the various attributes it may have, there should be
imputed the attribute of a mind capable of knowing and forming an intention —
indeed it is much too late in the day to suggest the contrary. It can only know or
form an intention through its human agents, but circumstances may be such that

the knowledge of the agent must be imputed to the body corporate.

[57] Lord Denning in Bolton (H.L.) (Engg.) Co. Lid. v. T.J. Graham &
Sons Lid. reported in (1957) 1 QB 159 summarized his findings in the following

words:

A company may in many ways be likened to a human body. They have a
brain and a nerve centre which controls what they do. They also have
hands which hold the tools and act in accordance with directions from
the centre. Some of the people in the company are mere servants and
agents who are nothing more than hands to do the work and cannot be
said to represent the mind or will. Others are directors and managers
who represent the directing mind and will of the company, and control
what they do. The state of mind of these managers is the state of mind of
the company and Is treated by the law as such. $0 you will find that in
cases where the law requires personal fault as a condition of liability in
tort, the fault of the manager will be the personal fault of the company.

That is made clear in Lord Haldane’s speech in Lennard’s Carrying Co.

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 25 of 26
Ltd. v. Asiatic Petroleurn Co. Ltd. So also in the criminal law, in cases
where the law requires a guilty mind as a condition of a criminal offence,
the guilty mind of the directors or the managers will render the company

themselves guilty.

[58] The petitioners being directly involved in the affairs of Meghalaya
Cements Ltd, and admittedly holding positions like Chairman and Directors of
the Company cannot get any reprieve by way of an application under Section
482 Cr.PC because of the nature of materials unearthed during investigation. It
would, thus, not be proper to invoke the jurisdiction vested in this Court under
Section 482 Cr.PC and quash the proceedings of GR 854/2014 pending in the

Court of Special Judicial Magistrate, Assam, Guwahati.

[59] Lastly, an argument has been made with reference to the order in
WP (C) 243/12 of this Court in order to show that dispute is civil in nature.
However, in view of the incriminating materials, already discussed hereinbefore,
this Court is not inclined to go into deeper aspects of the merits of defence. The
petitioners will be able to take all such defences as would be available to them

under law when the trial proceeds.

[60] In the result, the petitions are dismissed. The interim order passed

earlier stands vacated.

JUDGMENT & ORDER (CAV)

By way of this common judgment and order, | propose to
dispose of the Criminal Petition No. 189/2016 and Criminal Petition No.

192/2016 preferred under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

[2] It may be mentioned at the outset that both these cases were
heard and reserved for verdict. However, certain discrepancy was noticed in the
nomenclature of the case, sought to be quashed, hence the discrepancy was

brought to the notice of learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners. The learned

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 2 of 26
Senior Counsel for the petitioners, having realized the error, sought to file a
correction/modification application and accordingly vide |.A (Crl) No. 603/2017
in Criminal Petition No. 189/2016 and 1.A (Crl) No. 608/2017 in Criminal

Petition No. 192/2016 amendments were sought to be introduced.

[3] The amendments, sought to be introduced in Criminal Petition
No. 189/2016 and Criminal Petition No. 192/2016, were heard on 24.08.2017
and after considering that the proposed amendments are only clarificatory in
nature, prayers in both the Interlocutory Applications were allowed. The
amendments in Criminal Petition No. 189/2016 and Criminal Petition No.

192/2016 shall now be read as part of original petitions.

[4] The amendments, sought for, can be precisely stated as follows:

L. The Case No. in the original application was mentioned as CR

854/2016 which has been amended as GR 854/2016

ii. In the cause title as well as in the body of the petition it was
stated that the case is presently pending in the Court of learned
Chief Judicial Magistrate, Kamrup (Metro), Guwahati which
has, now, been corrected as learned Special Judicial Magistrate,

Assam, Guwahati

[5] Having dealt with the clarificatory aspects of the case | now

proceed to decide the case as follows;

[6] The petitioners 1, 2 and 3 in Criminal Petition No. 192/2016 are
the Directors of Meghalaya Cements Ltd, a company registered under the
Companies Act, 1956 and the petitioner No. 4 is an employee of the said

Company. On the other hand, the petitioner in Criminal Petition No. 189/2016

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 3 of 26
is the Chairman of said Meghalaya Cements Ltd. On a reading of the chargesheet
dated 27.3.2014, appended as Annexure 4 to this petition, the allegation against
the petitioners is that during the period of 2008-2011 some officials of North
Eastern Coal Fields, CIL, (hereinafter referred to NEC, CIL) entered into criminal
conspiracy with Sri Kailash Chand Lohia, Director of Meghalaya Cements Ltd. to
facilitate misuse of coal supplied from NEC, CIL under subsidized rates as per
National Coal Distribution Policy of Govt. of India. As per the Fuel Supply
Agreement done between NEC/CIL and Sri Kailash Chand Lohia for Meghalaya
Cements Ltd, coal to the tune of 38,000 metric tonnes per annum was allotted
to the Unit. Accordingly, the firm had lifted 70,413 metric tonnes of coal from
NEC, CIL but instead of transporting the said coal to Meghalaya Cements Ltd the
Director diverted the said coal for use in M/s K.D. Coke, Jorabat. The coal was
allotted and lifted at the rate of Rs 3680/- per tonne and rate fixed under Eauction is Rs 3851. The quantity of coal lifted by Meghalaya Cements Ltd would
have fetched an amount of Rs 15,50,25,136/- to the CIL if sold through e-auction
open market. Hence, wrongful loss was caused to CIL. Apart from the
allegations of cheating there are some other allegations that the petitioners
having entered into conspiracy created forged documents and used those
documents for the purpose of cheating. A chargesheet, thus, for the offences
under Section 420/468 read with Section 120B IPC has been laid against the

petitioners in both the cases.

[7] An FIR was lodged in this regard by Mr. H.C. Nath, IPS, Head of
Branch, CBI/ACB/Guwahati on 12.4.2011. The FIR was investigated, and after

investigation, a closure report, under Section 173 CrPC, was laid on 27.6.2012.

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 4 of 26
[8] As against the Closure Report, under Section 173 CrPC, the
impugned order, dated 4.8.12, was passed by learned Special Judge, Assam,
Guwahati, holding that since many aspects were left out during investigation the
Closure report cannot be accepted, and thereafter, the learned Special Judge
ordered re-investigation to be conducted by S$.P, CBI/ACB and to entrust a
competent officer other than Mr. R.C. Basumatary, to investigate the case and

submit report in final form.

[9] In the investigation that ensued thereafter, the impugned
chargesheet, Annexure 4, was laid against the petitioners in both the cases. Since
no materials against any public servants were found, the charges under the
Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, were dropped and hence, the chargesheet
was submitted in the Court of Special Judicial Magistrate, Assam, Guwahati, for
offences under Section 120B/420/409 IPC against the petitioners in both the

cases.

[10] Heard Mr. Diganta Das, learned Senior Counsel, appearing for
the petitioners in both the cases and also Mr. S.C. Keyal, learned Standing

Counsel, CBI.

[11] In the course of arguments, Mr. Das, learned Senior Counsel for

the petitioners laid emphasis on three aspects of law:

Firstly, the learned Special Judge could not have ordered re-investigation
of the case as re-investigation means fresh investigation, and hence, could

not have been so ordered

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 5 of 26
Secondly, for the offence committed by Company, if any, no vicarious
liability can be attached to the petitioners being Chairman, Directors and

employee of the Company

Thirdly, that, even if the allegations are taken on its face value yet no

offence is made out, and therefore, the chargesheet needs to be quashed.

[12] On the other hand, the learned Standing Counsel, CBI argued
that it is within the ambit of a Court sitting on a report under Section 173 CrPC

to reject the report an order further investigation.

[13] The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners has placed reliance
on the cases of Vinay Tyagi v. Irshad Ali, reported in (2013) 5 SCC 762, Anju
Chaudhary v. State of U.P., reported in (2013) 6 SCC 384, Rama Chaudhary v.
State of Bihar, reported in (2009) 6 SCC 346, Chandra Babu v. State, reported in
(2015) 8 SCC 774, and State of Orissa v. Mahima, reported in (2007) 15 SCC

580.

[14] In Mahima (supra), the Orissa High Court had quashed a further
investigation done by the Crime Branch on the ground of abuse of process. As
against the order of the Orissa High Court, the State preferred an appeal. In the
context of the factual scenario, the Hon’ble Supreme Court re-iterated the law
laid down in Hemant Dhasmana vs CBI, reported in (2001) 7 SCC 536 holding
that power of police to conduct further investigation in terms of Section 173 (8)

Cr.PC is unfettered.

[15] In Rama Chaudhary (supra), the police after investigation had laid
a charge sheet against the accused persons. In the course of trial, a

supplementary charge sheet was laid against the accused person, wherein the

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 6 of 26
Investigating Agency had mentioned the name of 8 new witnesses. The prayer of
the prosecution to examine those witnesses was allowed by the Sessions Judge.
Aggrieved by the order of Sessions Judge, the accused preferred a Criminal
Revision before the Hon’ble High Court of Patna.The order of Sessions Judge
was upheld by the Hon’ble High Court. As against the order of High Court, the
accused approached the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court, while upholding
the order of High Court as well as the Court of Session, held that it is settled law
that carrying out further investigation, even after filing of the charge-sheet, is a
statutory right of the police. The material collected in further investigation

cannot be rejected only because it has been filed at the stage of the trial.

[16] The other relevant observation of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in
Rama Chaudhary (supra), was that the police has a right to “further”
investigation under sub-section (8) of Section 173 but not “fresh investigation” or
“reinvestigation”. The meaning of “further” is additional, more, or
supplemental. “Further” investigation, therefore, is the continuation of the
earlier investigation and not a fresh investigation or reinvestigation to be started
ab initio wiping out the earlier investigation altogether. It further held that Subsection (8) of Section 173 clearly envisages that on completion of further
investigation, the investigating agency has to forward to the Magistrate a
“further” report and not a fresh report regarding the “further” evidence

obtained during such investigation.

[17] In Vinay Tyagi v. Irshad Ali, reported in (2013) 5 SCC 762, as
relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners, the following

questions came up for consideration before the Supreme Court:

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 7 of 26
(i) Whether in exercise of its powers under Section 173 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short “the Code”), the trial court
has the jurisdiction to ignore any one of the reports, where there are
two reports by the same or different investigating agencies in

furtherance of the orders of a court? If so, to what effect?

(ii) Whether the Central Bureau of Investigation (for short “CBI”) is
empowered to conduct “fresh”/ “reinvestigation” when the
cognizance has already been taken by the court of competent
jurisdiction on the basis of a police report under Section 173 of the

Code?

[18] In the course of deliberations, the Hon’ble Supreme Court in
Vinay Tyagi v. Irshad Ali, reported in (2013) 5 SCC 762, held that investigation

can be of the following kinds:
(i) Initial investigation,
(ii) Further investigation,
(iii) Fresh or de novo or reinvestigation.

[19] The “initial investigation” is the one which the empowered police
officer shall conduct in furtherance of registration of an FIR. Such investigation
itself can lead to filing of a final report under Section 173(2) of the Code and
shall take within its ambit the investigation which the empowered officer shall
conduct in furtherance of an order for investigation passed by the court of

competent jurisdiction in terms of Section 156(3) of the Code.

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 8 of 26
[20] “Further investigation” is where the investigating officer obtains
further oral or documentary evidence after the final report has been filed before
the court in terms of Section 173(8). This power is vested with the executive. It is
the continuation of previous investigation, and therefore, is understood and
described as “further investigation”. The scope of such investigation is restricted
to the discovery of further oral and documentary evidence. Its purpose is to
bring the true facts before the court even if they are discovered at a subsequent
stage to the primary investigation. It is commonly described as “supplementary
report”. “Supplementary report” would be the correct expression as the
subsequent investigation is meant and intended to supplement the primary
investigation conducted by the empowered police officer. Another significant
feature of further investigation is that it does not have the effect of wiping out,
directly or impliedly, the initial investigation conducted by the investigating
agency. This is a kind of continuation of the previous investigation. The basis is
discovery of fresh evidence and in continuation of the same offence and chain of
events relating to the same occurrence incidental thereto. In other words, it has
to be understood in complete contradistinction to a “reinvestigation”, “fresh” or

“de novo” investigation.

[21] However, in the case of a “fresh investigation”, “reinvestigation”
or “de novo investigation” there has to be a definite order of the court. The
order of the court unambiguously should state as to whether the previous
investigation, for reasons to be recorded, is incapable of being acted upon.
Neither the investigating agency nor the Magistrate has any power to order or
conduct “fresh investigation”. This is primarily for the reason that it would be

opposed to the scheme of the Code. It is essential that even an order of

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 9 of 26
“fresh”/“de novo” investigation passed by the higher judiciary should always be
coupled with a specific direction as to the fate of the investigation already
conducted. The cases where such direction can be issued are few and far
between. This is based upon a fundamental principle of our criminal
jurisprudence which is that it is the right of a suspect or an accused to have a just
and fair investigation and trial. This principle flows from the constitutional
mandate contained in Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution of India. Where the
investigation ex facie is unfair, tainted, mala fide and smacks of foul play, the
courts would set aside such an investigation and direct fresh or de novo
investigation and, if necessary, even by another independent investigating

agency.

[22] In Chandra Babu v. State, reported in (2015) 8 SCC 774, also
relied upon by the learned Standing Counsel, CBI, again an occasion arose
before the Hon’ble Supreme Court regarding the powers of Magistrate to pass
orders on further investigation and re-investigation. The Supreme Court
eventually held that under the Code of Criminal Procedure a Magistrate has

power to order further investigation but not reinvestigation.

[23] In view of the cases relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel, |
believe, it is not in dispute that once the Magistrate receives a report under
Section 173 CrPC on completion of investigation, ordering further investigation

is one of the courses open to the Magistrate.

[24] | may recall here the case of Abhinandan Jha v. Dinesh Mishra,
reported in (AIR 1968 SC 117) wherein the Supreme Court had the occasion to

deal with the question as to what is the position, when the Magistrate is dealing

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 10 of 26
with a report submitted by the police, under Section 173, that no case is made

out for sending up an accused for trial, which report is called as a ‘final report’?

[25] It was held in Abhinandan Jha (supra), that even in those cases, if
the Magistrate agrees with the said report, he may accept the final report and
close the proceedings. But there may be instances when the Magistrate may take
the view, on a consideration of the final report, that the opinion formed by the
police is not based on a full and complete investigation in which case the
Magistrate will have ample jurisdiction to give directions to the police, under
Section 156(3), to make a further investigation. That is, if the Magistrate feels,
after considering the final report, that the investigation is unsatisfactory, or
incomplete, or that there is scope for further investigation, it will be open to the
Magistrate to decline to accept the final report and direct the police to make
further investigation, under Section 156(3). The police, after such further
investigation, may submit a charge-sheet, or, again submit a final report,
depending upon the further investigation made by them. If, ultimately, the
Magistrate forms the opinion that the facts, set out in the final report, constitute
an offence, he can take cognizance of the offence, under Section 190(1)(b),

notwithstanding the contrary opinion of the police, expressed in the final report.

[26] Now, when the report, forwarded, under Clause (i) of SubSection (2) of Section 173, by the officer-in-charge of a police station to the
Magistrate, comes up for consideration by the Magistrate, one of two different
situations may, as pointed out in Bhagwant Singh v. Commr. of Police, reported
in (1985) 2 SCC 537 may arise. The report may conclude that an offence appears
to have been committed by a particular person or persons and, in such a case,

the Magistrate may do one of three things: (i) he may accept the report and take

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 11 of 26
‘cognizance’ of the offence or offences, as the case may be, and issue process or
(ii) he may disagree with the report and drop the proceeding or (iii) he may
direct 'further investigation’ under sub-section (3) of Section 156 and require the

police to submit a further report.

[27] In the case of Mithabhai Pashabhai Patel v. State of Gujarat,
reported in (2009) 6 SCC 332, the Hon’ble Supreme Court held that it is,
however, beyond any cavil that “further investigation” and “reinvestigation”
stand on different footing. It may be that in a given situation a superior court in
exercise of its constitutional power, namely, under Articles 226 and 32 of the
Constitution of India could direct a “State” to get an offence investigated and/or
further investigated by a different agency. Direction of a_ reinvestigation,
however, being forbidden in law, no superior court would ordinarily issue such
a direction. A distinction, therefore, exists between a reinvestigation and further

investigation.

[28] The relevant observations of Hon’ble Supreme Court, in

Mithabhai Pashabhai Patel (supra), are reproduced as follows:

“13. It is, however, beyond any cavil that “further investigation”
and “reinvestigation” stand on different footing. It may be that in
a given situation a superior court in exercise of its constitutional
power, namely, under Articles 226 and 32 of the Constitution of
India could direct a “State” to get an offence investigated and/or
further investigated by a different agency. Direction of a
reinvestigation, however, being forbidden in law, no superior

court would ordinarily issue such a direction.”

[29] The discussions, made above, may be summarized in the

following manner:

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 12 of 26
(i) That, police has a right to “further” investigation under sub-section
(8) of Section 173 but not “fresh investigation” or “reinvestigation”.
The meaning of “further” is additional, more, or supplemental.
“Further” investigation, therefore, is the continuation of the earlier
investigation and not a fresh investigation or reinvestigation to be

started ab initio wiping out the earlier investigation altogether.

(ii) In the case of a “fresh investigation”, “reinvestigation” or “de
novo investigation” there has to be a definite order of the court. The
order of the court unambiguously should state as to whether the
previous investigation, for reasons to be recorded, is incapable of
being acted upon. Neither the investigating agency nor the
Magistrate has any power to order or conduct “fresh investigation”.
It is essential that even an order of “fresh”/“de novo” investigation
passed by the higher judiciary should always be coupled with a
specific direction as to the fate of the investigation already

conducted.

(iii) If the Magistrate feels, after considering the final report, that the
investigation is unsatisfactory, or incomplete, or that there is scope
for further investigation, it will be open to the Magistrate to decline
to accept the final report and direct the police to make further
investigation, under Section 156(3). The police, after such further
investigation, may submit a charge-sheet, or, again submit a final

report, depending upon the further investigation made by them.

(iv) If in a given situation a superior court in exercise of its

constitutional power, namely, under Articles 226 and 32 of the

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 13 of 26
Constitution of India directs a “State” to get an offence investigated
and/or further investigated by a different agency wiping out previous
investigation such investigation would be called re-investigation.
Direction of a reinvestigation, however, being forbidden in law, no
superior court would ordinarily issue such a direction. A distinction,

therefore, exists between a reinvestigation and further investigation

[30] Thus, in the light of the cases, discussed hereinbefore, what
emerges is that if the Investigating Agency, after conducting investigation, lays a
charge sheet against the accused persons upon which Magistrate takes cognizance
and trial proceeds, what is permissible for the Police is to submit only additional
and further reports u/s 173 (8) Cr.PC and not a new and fresh report. However,
the said scenario cannot be conceived of in a situation where the Magistrate is
ordering further investigation in exercise of powers u/s 156(3) CrPC by rejecting
the opinion of Investigating Officer. Once such further investigation is ordered a
fresh investigation can be conducted and a new report can be filed and there
appears no hindrance in law that new opinion cannot be given. If it is argued
that even after ordering further investigation the Investigating Agency must stick
to its previous opinion, then the very purpose of further investigation would be

rendered nugatory.

[31] In the present case so far as the order of the learned Special Judge
is concerned he had ordered a re-investigation by the CBI and by a different
Officer. Keeping aside the use of expression re-investigation in the context of the
order, | may point out that the practice of ordering that investigation shall be
carried out by a particular Officer also came up for discussion in Hemant

Dhasmana v. CBI, reported in (2001) 7 SCC 536, wherein the Supreme Court

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 14 of 26
held in clear terms that it is not within the province of the Magistrate while
exercising the power under Section 173(8) to specify any particular officer to
conduct such investigation, not even to suggest the rank of the officer who
should conduct such investigation. Hence, the order of the learned Special Judge,
that investigation should be conducted by an officer other that Mr. R.C.
Basumatary, was not proper though on this count the order would not stand

vitiated.

[32] Now, coming to the use of expression re-investigation indeed in
view of the law laid down it would not have been permissible for the Special
Judge, to order re-investigation. But, the question which needs to be determined

here is whether by the impugned order a re-investigation has been conducted?

[33] The first test of re-investigation is that a fresh investigation
should, ordinarily, be conducted by an agency other than the one which has
already conducted investigation. The second aspect of re-investigation is

observation regarding previous mala fide investigation.

[34] In the present case, the learned Special Judge has only ordered reinvestigation by CBI, the same agency that conducted the previous investigation.
Secondly, there is no observation regarding any mala fides on the part of the
investigating agency regarding previous investigation. Hence, even though the
expression used is re-investigation, infact, what the learned Special Judge meant
was further investigation. The use of expression re-investigation, in the context
of present case, has to be termed as misnomer or a legally inaccurate expression.
Thus, not much can be read and should be read into the expression re
investigation when otherwise only further investigation has been conducted in

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 15 of 26
terms of the power conferred by Section 156(3) CrPC which the learned Special

Judge possessed.

[35] Thus, the order of the learned Special Judge, cannot be assailed

on this ground.

[36] Now, coming to the other leg of arguments, made by the learned
Senior Counsel for the petitioners, about corporate criminal liability how far a
juristic person can be made criminally liable for offences remained an unsettled
issue till the case of /ridium India Telecom Ltd. v. Motorola Inc., reported in
(2011) 1 SCC 74. \n this case, Iridium India had filed a criminal complaint against
Motorola Inc. alleging commission of offence under Section 420/120B IPC. The
complaint was quashed by the Bombay High Court. When the matter was
challenged in Hon’ble Supreme Court, by Iridium India, one of the grounds
taken by them was that the respondent Company cannot hide behind the
defence that the Company is incapable of possessing the necessary mens rea for
commission of the offence of cheating. While answering the rival arguments
made on the point of criminal liability of a corporate body the Hon’ble Supreme
Court, in /ridium India Telecom Ltd. (supra), held in categorical terms that a
corporation is virtually in the same position as any individual and may be
convicted of common law as well as statutory offences including those requiring
mens rea. The criminal liability of a corporation would arise when an offence is
committed in relation to the business of the corporation by a person or body of
persons in control of its affairs. In such circumstances, it would be necessary to
ascertain that the degree and control of the person or body of persons is so

intense that a corporation may be said to think and act through the person or

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 16 of 26
the body of persons. Mens rea is attributed to corporations on the principle of

“alter ego” of the company.

[37]

The relevant paragraph in /ridium India Telecom Lid. (supra), is

reproduced as follows;

[38]

63... it becomes evident that a corporation is virtually in the
same position as any individual and may be convicted of
common law as well as statutory offences including those
requiring mens rea. The criminal liability of a corporation would
arise when an offence is committed in relation to the business of
the corporation by a person or body of persons in control of its
affairs. In such circumstances, it would be necessary to ascertain
that the degree and control of the person or body of persons is so
intense that a corporation may be said to think and act through
the person or the body of persons. The position of law on this
issue in Canada is almost the same. Mens rea is attributed to

corporations on the principle of “alter ego” of the company.

It was further held that a company/corporation cannot escape

liability for a criminal offence merely because the punishment prescribed is that

of imprisonment and fine.

[39]

The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners has referred to the

cases of Sunil Bharti Mittal vs CBI, reported in (2015) 4 SCC 609, Thermax

Limited vs K.M. Johny, reported in (2011) 13 SCC 412, Asoke Basak v. State of

Maharashtra, reported in (2010) 10 SCC 660, Maksud Saiyed vs State of Gujrat,

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 17 of 26
reported in (2008) 5 SCC 668, and S.K. Alagh vs State of U.P, reported in

(2008) 5 SCC 662.

[40] In Sunil Bharti Mittal (supra), a charge sheet was laid against 4
persons. However, when the matter was taken up for the cognizance, the Special
Judge held that Mr Sunil Bharti Mittal was Chairman-cum-Managing Director of
Bharti Cellular Ltd., Mr. Asim Ghosh was Managing Director of Hutchison Max
Telecom (P) Ltd. and Mr Ravi Ruia was a Director in Sterling Cellular Ltd., who
used to chair the meetings of its Board. According to him, in that capacity, these
persons, prima facie, could be treated as controlling the affairs of the respective
companies and represent the directing mind and will of each company. They
were, thus, “alter ego” of their respective companies and the acts of the
companies could be attributed and imputed to them. On this premise, the
Special Judge felt that there was enough material on record to proceed against
these three persons as well. Thus, while taking cognizance of the case, he
decided to issue summons not only to the four accused named in the charge
sheet but the aforesaid three persons as well.

[41] On the facts of the case in Sunil Bharti Mittal (supra) itself it can
be said that this case may not be of any assistance to decide the present subject
matter as it is not the case of the petitioners that without they being named in
the charge sheet, processes have been issued against them without recording a
prima facie observation regarding their liability. The admitted position is that

petitioners have been charge sheeted as accused in the case in hand.

[42] In any view of the matter, the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Sunil
Bharti Mittal (supra), elucidated the law laid down in /ridium India (supra), and

held that the legal proposition that is laid down in the aforesaid judgment in

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 18 of 26
Iridium India (supra) is that if the person or group of persons who control the
affairs of the company commit an offence with a criminal intent, their criminality

can be imputed to the company as well as they are “alter ego” of the company.

[43] The cases of Thermax Ltd. v. K.M. Johny, reported in (2011) 13
SCC 412, Asoke Basak v. State of Maharashtra, reported in (2010) 10 SCC 660,
Maksud Saiyed v. State of Gujarat, reported in (2008) 5 SCC 668 andAsoke
Basak v. State of Maharashtra, reported in (2010) 10 SCC 660 do not seem to
have deviated from the law laid down in /ridium India (supra), rather on factual
analysis the Hon’ble Supreme Court found that no case is made out. Whether in
the present case offence is made out against the petitioners is being discussed

hereinafter.

[44] In $.K. Alagh v. State of U.P., reported in (2008) 5 SCC 662, a
criminal complaint was filed against the Managing Director and the General
Manager of Britannia Industries Ltd for offence under Section 405 IPC. The
company itself was not made an accused. It was in these context the Hon’ble
Supreme Court had held that as, admittedly, drafts were drawn in the name of
the Company, the Managing Director, cannot be said to have committed an
offence under Section 406 of the Penal Code. If and when a é statute
contemplates creation of such a legal fiction, it provides specifically therefor. In
absence of any provision laid down under the statute, a Director of a Company
Or an employee cannot be held to be vicariously liable for any offence

committed by the Company itself.

[45] The ratio of $.K. Alagh (supra) is not found to be applicable in
the present case because in §$.K. Alagh (supra), it was the company which was

alleged to have committed the offence, but instead of making the company as

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 19 of 26
accused its Managing Director was impleaded as accused on the principles of
vicarious liability. However, in the present case company has been made accused
and the petitioners are alleged to be the directing mind and will of the company

as its Directors.

[46] What emerges from the discussion undertaken hereinbefore is as

follows:

(i) A corporation is virtually in the same position as any individual
and may be convicted of common law as well as statutory offences
including those requiring mens rea. The criminal liability of a
corporation would arise when an offence is committed in relation to
the business of the corporation by a person or body of persons in
control of its affairs. In such circumstances, it would be necessary to
ascertain that the degree and control of the person or body of
persons is so intense that a corporation may be said to think and act

through the person or the body of persons.

(ii) If the company is not impleaded as an accused its Managing
Director or any other Official cannot be made vicariously liable for

the acts committed by the company

(iii) If on a reading of uncontroverted facts no offence is made out a

complaint or proceeding can be quashed.

[47] It now needs to be seen as to what is the nature of allegations

against the petitioners.

[48] The petitioners 1, 2 and 3 in Criminal Petition No. 192/2016 are

the Directors of Meghalaya Cements Ltd, a company registered under the

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 20 of 26
Companies Act, 1956 and the petitioner No. 4 is an employee of the said
Company. On the other hand, the petitioner in Criminal Petition No. 189/2016
is the Chairman of said Meghalaya Cements Ltd. On a reading of the
chargesheet, dated 27.3.2014, appended as Annexure 4 to this petition, the
allegation against the petitioners is that during the period of 2008-2011 some
officials of North Eastern Coal Fields, CIL, entered into criminal conspiracy with
Sri Kailash Chand Lohia, Director of Meghalaya Cements Ltd. to facilitate misuse
of coal supplied from NEC, CIL under subsidized rates as per National Coal
Distribution Policy of Govt. of India. As per the Fuel Supply Agreement, done
between NEC/CIL and Sri Kailash Chand Lohia for Meghalaya Cements Ltd, coal
to the tune of 38,000 metric tonnes per annum was allotted to the Unit.
Accordingly, the firm had lifted 70,413 metric tonnes of coal from NEC, CIL.But,
instead of transporting the said coal to Meghalaya Cements Ltd, the Director
diverted the said coal for use in M/s K.D. Coke, Jorabat. The coal was allotted
and lifted at the rate of Rs 3680/- per tonne and rate fixed under E-auction
wasRs 3851/-. The quantity of coal lifted by Meghalaya Cements Ltd would have
fetched an amount of Rs 15,50,25,136/- to the CIL it sold through e-auction

open market. Hence, wrongful loss was caused to CIL.

[49] As against the heading “Charge” in Annexure 4, an elaborate
factual allegations have been portrayed. Though there are enough incriminating
circumstances as to how the coal obtained at subsidized rate was misused for
purpose other than the purpose meant for Meghalaya Cements Ltd. it would be
sufficient for the purpose of present adjudication if some sets of allegations are

brought on record.

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 21 of 26
[50] One of the allegation is that during investigation it was revealed
that consignment of coal lifted from NEC, CIL had to be transported through
Taxation Check Gate, Byrnihat, Megahalaya. It was revealed that a total of 2956
numbers of trucks was shown to have crossed Byrnihat Check gate carrying coal
from NEC, CIL in the name of Meghalaya Cements Ltd to its factory premises
Topcem Cements. These movements of trucks were verified with the
Commissioner of Taxes, Meghalaya, Shillong with a request to verify whether
the alleged movement of 2956 numbers of trucks infact took place. The
Commissioner of Taxes in his communications to CBI informed that a total of
295 numbers of truck had crossed the Taxation Check Gate. The Superintendent
of Taxes, however, informed that a total of 278 numbers of truck had crossed
the check Gate during the period of 1/7/2008 to 31/03/2011. Again, as per the
information received from the Superintendent of Taxes, of the total 278 trucks
not all the trucks had transported coal, rather; some of the trucks had
transported Fly Ash, Coke, LPG etc though the road permits show that coal was
transported. The Investigating Agency, thus, infers that if one truck can transport
23 MT coal, then 295 trucks could transport only 6785 MT of coal, thereby

showing, that 63,628 MT coal was diverted by Meghalaya Cements Ltd.

[51] The other allegation is that Office Stamp of Taxation Check Gate,
the Seal impression of Taxation Inspector appearing on the Road Challan,
Permits, Transport Documents of the Meghalaya Cements Ltd. transporting the

coal, were fake stamp and fake stamp signatures.

[52] These two sets of allegations, among a host of other allegations
are quite incriminating in nature. In State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal, reported in

1992 Supp (1) SCC 335, certain circumstances were laid down by the Hon’ble

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 22 of 26
Supreme Court when a complaint/FIR can be quashed. Those circumstances are

as follows:

(i) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the
complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in
their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a

case against the accused.

(ii) Where the allegations in the first information report and other
materials, if any, accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable
offence, justifying an investigation by police officers under Section
156(1) of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the

purview of Section 155(2) of the Code.

(iii) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or
complaint and the evidence collected in support of the same do not
disclose the commission of any offence and make out a case against

the accused.

(iv) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable
offence but constitute only a non-cognizable offence, no investigation
is permitted by a police officer without an order of a Magistrate as

contemplated under Section 155(2) of the Code.

(v) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd
and inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person
can ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for

proceeding against the accused.

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 23 of 26
(vi) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the
provisions of the Code or the concerned Act (under which a criminal
proceeding is instituted) to the institution and continuance of the
proceedings and/or where there is a specific provision in the Code or
the concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for the grievance of

the aggrieved party.

(vii) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala
fide and/or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an
ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a

view to spite him due to private and personal grudge.

[53] Applying the test laid down in the case of Bhajan Lal (supra) it
cannot be said, in the context of present case, that even uncontroverted
allegations do not make out any case. As there are strong prima facie materials
of tax evasion, cheating, and forgery, on facts, no case is made out for quashing

the proceedings.

[54] There is yet another aspect on which arguments have been
advanced and which needs appreciation. It is the contention of petitioners,
particularly in Criminal Petition No. 192/2016, that petitioner No. 4 Sri
Girdharilal Bathwal is only a Manager (Stores) and that he has been wrongly
implicated in this case. However, on perusal of charge sheet, Annexure 4, it is
found that petitioner No. 4, as Senior Manager (Stores), created false records of
receipt of coal consignments. | believe, embarking into any kind of inquiry to
ascertain the truthfulness of such allegations, at this stage, would be highly

prejudicial to the prosecution case. Hence, the argument has no force.

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 24 of 26
[55] As to the culpability of the petitioners, in both the cases, | may
point out certain observation of Courts in England, which have quoted with

approval in Iridium India (supra).

[56] In Director of Public Prosecutions v. Kent and Sussex Contractors
Lid. reported in (1944) 1 All ER 119 (DC) it was held that a body corporate is a
“person” to whom, amongst the various attributes it may have, there should be
imputed the attribute of a mind capable of knowing and forming an intention —
indeed it is much too late in the day to suggest the contrary. It can only know or
form an intention through its human agents, but circumstances may be such that

the knowledge of the agent must be imputed to the body corporate.

[57] Lord Denning in Bolton (H.L.) (Engg.) Co. Lid. v. T.J. Graham &
Sons Lid. reported in (1957) 1 QB 159 summarized his findings in the following

words:

A company may in many ways be likened to a human body. They have a
brain and a nerve centre which controls what they do. They also have
hands which hold the tools and act in accordance with directions from
the centre. Some of the people in the company are mere servants and
agents who are nothing more than hands to do the work and cannot be
said to represent the mind or will. Others are directors and managers
who represent the directing mind and will of the company, and control
what they do. The state of mind of these managers is the state of mind of
the company and Is treated by the law as such. $0 you will find that in
cases where the law requires personal fault as a condition of liability in
tort, the fault of the manager will be the personal fault of the company.

That is made clear in Lord Haldane’s speech in Lennard’s Carrying Co.

Criminal Petition No. 189 & 192 OF 2016 Page 25 of 26
Ltd. v. Asiatic Petroleurn Co. Ltd. So also in the criminal law, in cases
where the law requires a guilty mind as a condition of a criminal offence,
the guilty mind of the directors or the managers will render the company

themselves guilty.

[58] The petitioners being directly involved in the affairs of Meghalaya
Cements Ltd, and admittedly holding positions like Chairman and Directors of
the Company cannot get any reprieve by way of an application under Section
482 Cr.PC because of the nature of materials unearthed during investigation. It
would, thus, not be proper to invoke the jurisdiction vested in this Court under
Section 482 Cr.PC and quash the proceedings of GR 854/2014 pending in the

Court of Special Judicial Magistrate, Assam, Guwahati.

[59] Lastly, an argument has been made with reference to the order in
WP (C) 243/12 of this Court in order to show that dispute is civil in nature.
However, in view of the incriminating materials, already discussed hereinbefore,
this Court is not inclined to go into deeper aspects of the merits of defence. The
petitioners will be able to take all such defences as would be available to them

under law when the trial proceeds.

[60] In the result, the petitions are dismissed. The interim order passed

earlier stands vacated.

[2] This revision is directed against the judgment and order dated
12.12.2007 passed by learned Sessions Judge, Guwahti in Cri. Appeal
No.45/2007 whereby dismissing the appeal and upholding the judgment of
conviction of the accused and sentencing him to SI for 1 year and to pay

compensation of Rs.1,00,000.

[3] As per the prosecution case, the revision petitioner and the
respondent were in friendly terms and the revision petitioner obtained a loan of
Rs.75,000/- and in order to repay the said load, he issued two cheques being
cheque No.094299 for an amount of Rs.50,000/- and cheque No.093469 for an
amount of Rs.25,000/-. The respondent complainant presented the cheque for
encashment which were dishonored. Thereafter he issued notice as per
requirement of Section 138 NI Act and when the revision petitioner failed to
make any payment within 15 days of the receipt of such notice, the complaint

was lodged.

[4] In course of trial, the complainant examined himself and two other
witnesses, who have supported the prosecution case and on appreciation of
evidence, learned magistrate convicted the revision petitioner under Section 138
NI Act and awarded sentence as indicated above. The revision petitioner
preferred an appeal and the learned Sessions J udge by the impugned judgment
and order dismissed the appeal and affirmed the conviction and sentence

awarded by the learned trial Court.

[5] Aggrieved by the impugned judgment, the revision petitioner preferred

the instant appeal.

[6] From the grounds taken in the revision petition, it appears that that
only question that has been raised in this revision petition is whether the notice
under clause (b) of the proviso to section 138 NI Act was received by the
revision petitioner or not. It has been contended in the petition that no such
notice under clause (b) of the proviso to Section 138 NI Act was received and

therefore, the conviction and sentence was illegal and improper.

Crt. Rev. P No.203/ 2008
[7] Pw-3 stated categorically in his evidence that notice was sent by
Registered Post with A/D, the copy of which has been proved as exhibit-11. The
postal receipt has been proved as exhibit-14. It has also been stated by this
witness, that as the AD card was not received, his counsel wrote a letter to the
postmaster enquiring about the delivery of the notice and the postmaster has
issued certificate, which has been proved as exhibit-15(1), showing that the
letter was delivered to the addressee on 09.10.2004. Therefore, oral testimony
of Pw-3 together with the documentary evidence, exhibit-13, exhibit-14 and
exhibit-15 clearly establishes that notice was served on the revision petitioner on
09.10.2004. No rebuttal evidence was adduced by the revision petitioner to
controvert the above evidence with regard to service of notice. Learned Sessions
Judge is also found to have discussed this issue and appreciating the evidence
came to finding that notice was duly served on the revision petitioner on
09.10.2004. When the specific plea of the revision petitioner was that notice
was not received and the complainant adduced evidence to prove the sending as
well as receipt of the notice by the revision petitioner burden necessarily shifted
to the revision petitioner, to rebut such evidence, but no such rebuttal evidence
was adduced. In the face of such evidence, the finding of the learned Sessions
Judge affirming the conviction and sentence of the revision petitioner, in my
view, has not suffered from any illegality or impropriety warranting interference
by this Court.

JUDGMENT & ORDER (ORAL)

This is a Criminal Revision Petition, filed under Sections 397/401
read with Section 482 of the Cr.PC, praying for setting aside the judgment
and order, dated 23.08.2007, passed by the learned Sessions Judge, in
Criminal Appeal No. 18/2007, sentencing the accused petitioner to suffer

Simple Imprisonment for 3 (three) months under Section 323 of the IPC.

2. Heard Mr. P Bhowmick, learned counsel for the revision
petitioner. Also heard Mr. NJ Dutta, learned Additional Public Prosecutor,

appearing for the State of Assam.

Cri. Rev. P. No. 301 of 2007 Page 1 of 5
3. | have perused the petition as well as the impugned order

annexed with the petition.

4. The case for the prosecution is that, Sri Bapchand Das of Jorhat,
filed an FIR on 02.11.2004 with the Jorhat Police Station, alleging that on
30.10.2004, at about 7:30 pm, the present accused petitioner along with
other co-accused, Sri Nirman Das, Sri Ganesh Das, Sri Jitu Das and Sri Titu
Das trespassed into his house, assaulted his father Sri. Bhebela Das with

sharp and blunt weapons, causing injuries to his person.

5. On receipt of the FIR, the Jorhat Police Station registered a case,
being No. 333/2004, investigated into it, collected evidence, arrested the
accused persons, and finally, submitted charge-sheet against the accused

persons under Sections 147/447/323 of the IPC.

6. The learned Trial Court explained particulars of offences to the
accused persons, on their appearance, under Sections 147/447/323 of the
IPC and the accused persons, including the present accused petitioner

pleaded innocence. Accordingly, the trial commenced.

7. The prosecution examined as many as 7 (seven) witnesses in the

case, including the Investigating Police Officer and the Doctor.
8. | have meticulously examined the evidence on record.

9. It appears from the materials on record that the PW6 and PW7
in this case are respectively the Doctor and the Investigating Police Officer.

Other 5 (five) witnesses are from the same family.

10. The allegation made in the FIR as well as in the evidence of the
PW2 that the accused petitioner assaulted his father/injured with a sword.
PW2 stated that the accused petitioner entered into his house with an
intention to assault him but as he was not available, the accused petitioner

assaulted his father/injured. There is an admission from the PW2 himself

Cri. Rev. P. No. 301 of 2007 Page 2 of 5
that there was previous enemity between the parties for which he was

targeted by the accused petitioner and the other co-accused.

11. The injured PW1 appears to be a person of 90 years of age on
the date of occurrence. He is found to have stated in his evidence that the
present accused petitioner assaulted him with a sword and the other

accused persons assaulted him with a stick.

12. The concern in this present revision petition is the accusation

levelled against the present petitioner, Sri Mridul Das.

13. According to the PW1, he was assaulted by the present accused

petitioner with a sword.

14. The evidence of PW3, PW4 and PW5 makes it appear that the
entry of the present accused petitioner along with other co-accused in their
house, as alleged in the FIR, is substantiated and during the crossexamination, the defence failed to assail there entry to the house of the
injured/PW/1 in the late evening on the date of occurrence with intention to

commit some offence.

15. The evidence of PW6, who is the Doctor clearly shows that he
did not find any injury caused by sharp weapon, as alleged by the injured

in his evidence, examined as PW1.

16. The evidence of the Investigating Police Officer/PW7 also makes
it appear that the only injury, the kind of which is caused by stick could be
found in the person of the injured, which found corroboration from the

evidence of the Doctor, examined as PW6.

17. The specific accusation against the present accused petitioner is
that he has inflicted injuries on the person of the PW1 with a sword, which
is not a fact in view of the evidence of PW6 that there was no such injury

found which could have been caused by a sharp weapon. There is no

Cri. Rev. P. No. 301 of 2007 Page 3 of 5
allegation against the accused petitioner that he caused injuries to the
injured/PW/1 other than that of a sword. The allegation of causing injuries
on the person of the injured with a stick is in respect of the other co
accused, not the present petitioner.

18. But, the fact remains that the present accused petitioner and
other co-accused entered into the house of the injured/PW1 in a group in
the late evening on the date of occurrence and the injured/PW1 was a
person of 90 years of age for which a definite observation as to which of

the accused person played what role cannot be made in such a situation.

19. Observation of different persons, to a particular incident, may be
different. All persons witnessing an occurrence cannot be expected to

observe a particular incident in a same way as the others.

20. That being so, inspite of the fact that the injured/PW1 did not
specifically state that the present petitioner inflicted stick blow on his
person, yet in the facts and circumstances of the case, it cannot be straight

away said that he has no role in causing injuries to the injured/PW1.

21. | have found that the learned Trial Court as well as the Appellate
Court of the learned Sessions Judge appreciated the evidence on record
thoroughly and the judgment passed by the learned Trial Court was based
on the evidence on record, and therefore, the learned Appellate Court of
the Sessions Judge did not interfered with that except modification of

sentence to a little extent.

22. This Court also, on scrutiny of the evidence on records, finds that
there is no such illegality and impropriety in the judgment of the learned
Trial Court and affirmed by the learned Appellate Court of the Sessions
Judge to justify interference, so far the holding of the accused petitioner

guilty of commission of the offences under Sections 323/447 of the IPC.

Cri. Rev. P. No. 301 of 2007 Page 4 of 5
23. Therefore, the order of conviction of the accused petitioner is
upheld. So far the sentence is concerned, the accused petitioner was
sentenced to Simple Imprisonment for 3 (three) months and 1 (one) month,
respectively under Sections 323/447 of the IPC. The Appellate Court of the
learned Sessions Judge reduced the sentence from Simple Imprisonment for

1 (one) month to fine of Rs. 500/-.

24. | have considered the fact that the date of occurrence in this case
is 30.10.2004 and the present revision petitioner has fought a long drawn
legal battle till date and have now approached this Court. | have also
considered the facts and circumstances of the case as well as the fact that

the other co-accused has already been enlarged on probation.

25. Taking into consideration the above aspects, instead of
substantive sentence of 3 (three) months under Section 323 of the IPC, if
the accused petitioner is imposed with a fine of Rs. 500, it will meet the
ends of justice and so far sentence under Section 447 of the IPC is
concerned, fine of Rs. 500/- imposed by the learned Appellate Court of the
Sessions Judge after modifying the sentence, the same is enhanced to Rs.

1,000/
26. Accordingly, the accused petitioner is sentenced to pay a fine of
Rs. 1,000/- on each count under Sections 447/323 of the IPC, and in
default, to suffer Simple Imprisonment for 15 (fifteen) days on each count
consecutively. He is directed to surrender before the learned Trial Court

within 15 (fifteen) days from today to undergo the sentence.
27. Accordingly, the present revision petition stands disposed of.
28. Send back the LCR along with a copy of the judgment.

JUDGMENT AND ORDER (Oral)

This Criminal Revision Petition, before this court, is under Section
397/401 Cr.PC., challenging the legality and propriety of the judgment and order,
dated 3.10.2007, passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Sonitpur, Tezpur, in
Criminal Appeal No. 7(S-1)/2007, dismissing the appeal and upholding the
judgment and order passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate, 1° Class,
Sonitpur, Tezpur, in GR Case No. 1534/2003, convicting the accused revision
petitioner under Section 279/304(A)/427 IPC, and sentencing him to suffer
rigorous imprisonment for 3 months under Section 279 IPC, rigorous
Imprisonment for 1 year under Section 304 (A) IPC and to pay a fine of

Page 10f 4
Crl.Rev.P.337/2007
Rs. 300/-, in default, simple imprisonment for 10 days under Section 427 IPC

with a further order to run the sentence concurrently.

2) Heard Mr. D Talukdar, learned counsel for the accused revision petitioner

as well as Mr. N K Kalita, learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the state.

3) The fact of the prosecution case is that, on 24.10.2003, at about 10:30
am, a bus bearing Reg. No. AS-25-A/8881, driven by the accused revision
petitioner, was proceeding from Tezpur side towards Kaliabor side, in a very high
Speed and knocked down a minor girl, Hashnara Khatoon, causing her instant
death and hit another cyclist Abdul Kalam, who died later on, in the hospital due
to the injuries sustained by him in the accident. The accident occurred near Kalia

Bhumura bridge on 31(A) National Highway.

4) On receipt of the FIR on the above facts, the Tezpur Police Station
registered a case under Sections 279/304(A)/427 IPC, investigated into it,
collected evidence, seized the bus involved in the accident along with the
documents and got the said bus examined by the Motor Vehicle Inspector,
arrested the accused person, and finally, submitted charge-sheet against the
accused revision petitioner under Section 279/304(A)/427 IPC.

5) In this case, the prosecution examined as many as 7 (seven) witnesses.
The learned trial court as well as the learned appellate court examined the
evidence on record and have convicted and sentenced the accused revision

petitioner as aforesaid.

6) It appears from the judgment of both the lower courts that both the said
courts relied upon the evidence of PW2, PW3 & PW5. Therefore, this court has
decided to scan the evidence, relied upon by the learned trial court, to see
whether the evidence justifies the findings of learned courts below in recording

the order of conviction of the accused revision petitioner.

7) The evidence of the PW2, Arman Ali is that he was waiting for a bus for
going to Tezpur and at that time the offending bus came at a high speed towards
Nagaon, hit the deceased Hashnara Begum, causing her instant death, and also
hit another cyclist Abdul Kalam who died in the hospital because of the injuries

Page 2 of 4
Crl.Rev.P.337/2007
sustained in the accident. The evidence of PW3 Hazira Khatoon is also similar
that she was also waiting for a bus near the place of occurrence, and at that
point of time, she noticed that a bus was coming from Tezpur side in excessive
speed and had hit a minor girl Hashnara Begum causing her death on the spot
and also hit a cyclist, who later on died in the hospital due to injury sustained by
him. The evidence of the PW5 is that he was also, like PW2 and PW3, was
waiting for a bus to travel to Tezpur at about 6-8 meter away from the place of
occurrence. He noticed at that time that deceased Hashnara Begum was
crossing the road from north to south, and a speeding bus hit her, causing her
Instant death and then hit another cyclist, Abdul Kalam, who also died later on in

the hospital.

8) The evidence of PW2, PW3 & PW5 makes it appear that there took place
an accident and two persons died. According to them, the bus which was
Involved in the accident, was being driven, at the relevant point of time, in a very

high speed, which is the cause of the accident.

9) It appears from the evidence of all the aforesaid 3 witnesses that none of
them was passenger of the vehicle and all of them were rather standing near the
place of occurrence waiting for a bus to travel to Tezpur. One of the witnesses,
.e. PW5, even deposed that the vehicle was plied at a high speed of about 140
knVhr in the National Highway at about 10:30 am. It is seen that on the
National Highway, at about 10:30 am, to ply a vehicle in 140 knVhr speed is
more than impossible. That apart, the speed of the vehicle could not be
assessed otherwise also as none of the passengers of the bus was examined.
The MVI report also suggest that the vehicle was mechanically in order at the
relevant time of accident. In the absence of any specific evidence, as to how the
accident occurred, particularly, the speed of the vehicle could not be ascertained
and the bus was mechanically in a fit condition. It seems to be a case of
negligence on the part of the driver so far his failure to stop the vehicle at the
relevant time of the accident in the place of occurrence is concerned. He would
have been able to prevent the accident had the vehicle been driven not in a high
speed. While the deceased Hashnara was crossing the road, he could have
stopped the bus had it been in normal speed.

Page 3 of 4
Crl.Rev.P.337/2007
10) Such being the evidence on record, and as the findings recorded by the
learned trial court as well as the appellate court, is based on proper evaluation of
the evidence on record, in the considered view of this court, no interference from

this court is called for so far the order of conviction is concerned.

11) = That being so, in the considered view of this court also, considering the
fact that this is an old pending case of the year 2003, if the substantive
punishment of the accused revision petitioner is set aside and punishment by

way of fine imposed, it will meet the ends of justice.

12) Accordingly, the substantive sentence of the accused revision petitioner is

set aside.
13) The accused revision petitioner is sentenced as follows:

The commission of offence under Section 279 IPC, fine of Rs.
1,000/-, in default, 15 days rigorous imprisonment, for the commission of
offence under Section 304(A) IPC a fine of Rs. 5,000/-, in default, 1
month rigorous imprisonment, and, for the commission of offence under
Section 427 IPC, a fine of Rs. 300/-, in default, 10 days simple

Imprisonment.

14) Accordingly, the accused revision petitioner is sentenced to fine as

indicated above.

15) = The accused revision petitioner will surrender before the learned trial

court for serving out the sentence within 1 (one) month.

16) = Send back the LCR along with a copy of this judgment.

JUDGMENT AND ORDER (Oral)

This Criminal Revision Petition, before this court, is under Section
397/401 Cr.PC., challenging the legality and propriety of the judgment and order,
dated 3.10.2007, passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Sonitpur, Tezpur, in
Criminal Appeal No. 7(S-1)/2007, dismissing the appeal and upholding the
judgment and order passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate, 1° Class,
Sonitpur, Tezpur, in GR Case No. 1534/2003, convicting the accused revision
petitioner under Section 279/304(A)/427 IPC, and sentencing him to suffer
rigorous imprisonment for 3 months under Section 279 IPC, rigorous
Imprisonment for 1 year under Section 304 (A) IPC and to pay a fine of

Page 10f 4
Crl.Rev.P.337/2007
Rs. 300/-, in default, simple imprisonment for 10 days under Section 427 IPC

with a further order to run the sentence concurrently.

2) Heard Mr. D Talukdar, learned counsel for the accused revision petitioner

as well as Mr. N K Kalita, learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the state.

3) The fact of the prosecution case is that, on 24.10.2003, at about 10:30
am, a bus bearing Reg. No. AS-25-A/8881, driven by the accused revision
petitioner, was proceeding from Tezpur side towards Kaliabor side, in a very high
Speed and knocked down a minor girl, Hashnara Khatoon, causing her instant
death and hit another cyclist Abdul Kalam, who died later on, in the hospital due
to the injuries sustained by him in the accident. The accident occurred near Kalia

Bhumura bridge on 31(A) National Highway.

4) On receipt of the FIR on the above facts, the Tezpur Police Station
registered a case under Sections 279/304(A)/427 IPC, investigated into it,
collected evidence, seized the bus involved in the accident along with the
documents and got the said bus examined by the Motor Vehicle Inspector,
arrested the accused person, and finally, submitted charge-sheet against the
accused revision petitioner under Section 279/304(A)/427 IPC.

5) In this case, the prosecution examined as many as 7 (seven) witnesses.
The learned trial court as well as the learned appellate court examined the
evidence on record and have convicted and sentenced the accused revision

petitioner as aforesaid.

6) It appears from the judgment of both the lower courts that both the said
courts relied upon the evidence of PW2, PW3 & PW5. Therefore, this court has
decided to scan the evidence, relied upon by the learned trial court, to see
whether the evidence justifies the findings of learned courts below in recording

the order of conviction of the accused revision petitioner.

7) The evidence of the PW2, Arman Ali is that he was waiting for a bus for
going to Tezpur and at that time the offending bus came at a high speed towards
Nagaon, hit the deceased Hashnara Begum, causing her instant death, and also
hit another cyclist Abdul Kalam who died in the hospital because of the injuries

Page 2 of 4
Crl.Rev.P.337/2007
sustained in the accident. The evidence of PW3 Hazira Khatoon is also similar
that she was also waiting for a bus near the place of occurrence, and at that
point of time, she noticed that a bus was coming from Tezpur side in excessive
speed and had hit a minor girl Hashnara Begum causing her death on the spot
and also hit a cyclist, who later on died in the hospital due to injury sustained by
him. The evidence of the PW5 is that he was also, like PW2 and PW3, was
waiting for a bus to travel to Tezpur at about 6-8 meter away from the place of
occurrence. He noticed at that time that deceased Hashnara Begum was
crossing the road from north to south, and a speeding bus hit her, causing her
Instant death and then hit another cyclist, Abdul Kalam, who also died later on in

the hospital.

8) The evidence of PW2, PW3 & PW5 makes it appear that there took place
an accident and two persons died. According to them, the bus which was
Involved in the accident, was being driven, at the relevant point of time, in a very

high speed, which is the cause of the accident.

9) It appears from the evidence of all the aforesaid 3 witnesses that none of
them was passenger of the vehicle and all of them were rather standing near the
place of occurrence waiting for a bus to travel to Tezpur. One of the witnesses,
.e. PW5, even deposed that the vehicle was plied at a high speed of about 140
knVhr in the National Highway at about 10:30 am. It is seen that on the
National Highway, at about 10:30 am, to ply a vehicle in 140 knVhr speed is
more than impossible. That apart, the speed of the vehicle could not be
assessed otherwise also as none of the passengers of the bus was examined.
The MVI report also suggest that the vehicle was mechanically in order at the
relevant time of accident. In the absence of any specific evidence, as to how the
accident occurred, particularly, the speed of the vehicle could not be ascertained
and the bus was mechanically in a fit condition. It seems to be a case of
negligence on the part of the driver so far his failure to stop the vehicle at the
relevant time of the accident in the place of occurrence is concerned. He would
have been able to prevent the accident had the vehicle been driven not in a high
speed. While the deceased Hashnara was crossing the road, he could have
stopped the bus had it been in normal speed.

Page 3 of 4
Crl.Rev.P.337/2007
10) Such being the evidence on record, and as the findings recorded by the
learned trial court as well as the appellate court, is based on proper evaluation of
the evidence on record, in the considered view of this court, no interference from

this court is called for so far the order of conviction is concerned.

11) = That being so, in the considered view of this court also, considering the
fact that this is an old pending case of the year 2003, if the substantive
punishment of the accused revision petitioner is set aside and punishment by

way of fine imposed, it will meet the ends of justice.

12) Accordingly, the substantive sentence of the accused revision petitioner is

set aside.
13) The accused revision petitioner is sentenced as follows:

The commission of offence under Section 279 IPC, fine of Rs.
1,000/-, in default, 15 days rigorous imprisonment, for the commission of
offence under Section 304(A) IPC a fine of Rs. 5,000/-, in default, 1
month rigorous imprisonment, and, for the commission of offence under
Section 427 IPC, a fine of Rs. 300/-, in default, 10 days simple

Imprisonment.

14) Accordingly, the accused revision petitioner is sentenced to fine as

indicated above.

15) = The accused revision petitioner will surrender before the learned trial

court for serving out the sentence within 1 (one) month.

16) = Send back the LCR along with a copy of this judgment.

Mongaon, in Cnminal Appeal No. 5,000/-, in default, to suffer further

simple impnsonment for 2 (two) months. Sinu Deka are their neighbours and they had received an
amount of Rs. According to
them, the amount was received as secunty deposits. On the above facts, the aforesaid three persons, namely, Sn
Jadav Das, Smt. Sewali Devi filed the FIR with
Mongaon Police Station, which was registered as Mongaon Police
Station Case No. On appearance of the accused-petitioner, a formal charge,

Innocence. In the statement

recorded under Section 313 CrP.C., the accused-petitioner denied

the allegations made against him and also declined to adduce any

evidence from his side. In this case, the prosecution examined as many as 10
witnesses, which included the Investigating Police Officer and the

defence examined none. The evidence of PW1 is that the accused-petitioner received
an amount of Rs. 25,000/- from him assunng that he would give an
employment to PW1’s son, Raju Das. Sandhani Das, wife of PW1, was also present at the
time of transaction between the accused-petitioner and PWI1. After three months, they

not provide the job as promised by the accused-petitioner. The
evidence of the aforesaid witnesses remained un-assailed during

3. The facts leading to the case Is that, Sn J adav Das, Smt. Lahan
Das and Smt. Sewali Devi lodged an FIR on 04-04-2004 in Morngaon
Police Station alleging that the accused persons Sn Upen Deka and
Smt. Sinu Deka are their neighbours and they had received an
amount of Rs. 25,000/-, Rs. 20,000/- and Rs. 30,000/- respectively from

contractor, astemporary measure. The boys retumed home after one
month as no employment was given to them by the accusedpetitioner, as assured. The accused also did not retum the money to

them on their demand; rather, avoided them on this or that pretext.

4. On the above facts, the aforesaid three persons, namely, Sn
Jadav Das, Smt. Lahan Das and Smt. Sewali Devi filed the FIR with
Mongaon Police Station, which was registered as Mongaon Police
Station Case No. 55/2004, under Sections 420/406 IPC, investigated
into it, collected evidence and then submitted charge-sheet under
Sections 420/406 of the IPC against the accused person. The co
accused named in the FIR, Smt. Sinu Deka, was not charge-sheeted.

5. On appearance of the accused-petitioner, a formal charge,
under Sections 420/406 of the IPC was framed to which he pleaded
Innocence. Therefore, the tnal commenced. In the statement

recorded under Section 313 CrP.C., the accused-petitioner denied

Cri. Rev. Pet. No. 339 of 2007 Page 2 of 6
the allegations made against him and also declined to adduce any

evidence from his side.

6. In this case, the prosecution examined as many as 10
witnesses, which included the Investigating Police Officer and the

defence examined none.

7. The evidence of PW1 is that the accused-petitioner received
an amount of Rs. 25,000/- from him assunng that he would give an
employment to PW1’s son, Raju Das. Although he demanded initially
an amount of Rs. 40,000/-.

8. PW4, Smt. Sandhani Das, wife of PW1, was also present at the
time of transaction between the accused-petitioner and PWI1. The
accused-petitioner took the son of PW1 with other candidates to
Guwahati, kept them in a rented house. After three months, they
went back to theirhomesasno job wasprovided to them as assured.
They were made to work under a contractor only instead of
employment in Oil Refinery. The accused-petitioner also refused to

retum the money taken from PW1.

9. PW2 and PW3 also deposed in the same way that the
accused-petitioner had taken the amount of Rs. 30,000/- and Rs.
10,000/- respectively from them with assurance that he would
arrange employment for the nephew and the son of PW2 and PW3
respectively in Noonmati Oil Refinery. The evidence of PW4 makes it
appear that he has consstently coroborated the evidence of PWs1,
2 and 3. PWs1l, 2 and 3 are also informants In this case and FIR (Ext.1)
wasexhibited through PW1.

10. PW5, Bhogeswar Konwar, also deposed that the accusedpetitioner received an amount of Rs. 20,000/- from him for giving him

job in Noonmati Oil Refinery.

11. PW/, Rajib Nath, who is the nephew of PW2 is found heard
saying in clear words that the accused-petitioner had taken Rs.
30,000/-, for arranging a job for him at Noonmati Oil Refinery, but did
not provide the job as promised by the accused-petitioner. The
evidence of the aforesaid witnesses remained un-assailed during

Cross-examination.

12. The evidence on record makes it appear that the accusedpetitioner, by taking money from the aforesaid PWs, particulary, PWs
1, 2, 3 and 5 assured them to provide job in Noonmati Oil Refinery
and by not providing job, as assured, he deceived them. He had put
them to believe, in the light of evidence of PWs 1 to 4, that he would
provide the job to them and for that purpose, he received some
money asindicated above. He not only failed to provide job, but also
avoided them when they demanded retum of money. Such conduct
of the accused-petitioner clearly indicates that he deceived the
aforesaid prosecution witnesses, by making false promise. Had he not
dishonestly induced them to part with money or to deliver money to
them, they would not have paid the amount, as aforesaid, to the
accused-petitioner and such act of the accused-petitioner amounts

to cheating asprovided in Section 420 of the IPC.

13. On perusal of the judgment of the leamed tnal Court aswellas
the judgment of the leamed appellate Court, it is clearny found that
the decisions rendered by both the leamed Courts below is based on
the evidence on record and there is no impropnety and illegality in

the judgments.

14. The leamed counsel for the accused-petitioner submitted that
the informants were provided with jobs by the accused-petitioner
under a contractor in the Noonmati Oil Refinery and as such the

promise made by the’ accused-petitioner was effectively

Cri. Rev. Pet. No. 339 of 2007 Page 4 of 6
matenalised, but the fact remains that the PWs 1 to 4 retumed home
back as they were not provided with the jobs in the Oil Refinery and
instead, they were made to work undera contractor there. While the
accused-petitioner assured for providing jobs in the Oil Refinery, it will
definitely mean that they will be provided jobsin the establishment of
Oil Refinery, not under a pnvate contractor. That apart, ‘job’ in the
Instant case, from the tone and tenor of the complaint as well as the

evidence on record, meansregular job with regular salary.

15. Leamed counsel for revision petitioner has submitted that the
promise was not to give a regular job in the Oj Refinery
establishment. At the same time, it hasto be noticed that the promise

wasalso not to provide job undera contractor.

16. That being so, the argument put forward by the leamed
counsel for the revision petitioner, as above, does not ment
consideration giving benefit to the accused-revison petitioner, which

would result in his acquittal.

17. = Inthe considered view of this Court, the judgments and orders
passed by both the Courts below appears to be on the bass of
matenals on record and both the judgments are well wntten with
appropnate legal and logical justification. Therefore, the order of
conviction recorded by the leamed tnal Court as well as confirmed
by leamed appellate Court of Sessions Judge, Mongaon, is

maintained.

18. So faras punishment is concemed, in the considered view of
this Court, the penod already undergone, if imposed as substantive
sentence and if the fine is enhanced to Rs. 15,000/-, it will meet the

ends of justice.

19. It is submitted at the Bar that the accused-petitioner was in

judicial custody dunng the investigation of the case fora penod of

Cri. Rev. Pet. No. 339 of 2007 Page 5 of 6
about 32 days, w.e.f. 10-12-2004 to 12-01-2005, therefore, as stated
above, the accused-revision petitioner is sentenced to the penod
already undergone, so far as substantive sentence isconcemed. The
fine imposed by the leamed Courts below on the accused-revision
petitioner is enhanced to Rs. 15,000/- and, in default, to suffer simple

impnsonment forone month.

back as they were not provided with the jobs in the Oil Refinery and
instead, they were made to work undera contractor there. While the
accused-petitioner assured for providing jobs in the Oil Refinery, it will
definitely mean that they will be provided jobsin the establishment of
Oil Refinery, not under a pnvate contractor. That apart, ‘job’ in the
Instant case, from the tone and tenor of the complaint as well as the

evidence on record, meansregular job with regular salary.

15. Leamed counsel for revision petitioner has submitted that the
promise was not to give a regular job in the Oj Refinery
establishment. At the same time, it hasto be noticed that the promise

wasalso not to provide job undera contractor.

16. That being so, the argument put forward by the leamed
counsel for the revision petitioner, as above, does not ment
consideration giving benefit to the accused-revison petitioner, which

would result in his acquittal.

by leamed appellate Court of Sessions Judge, Mongaon, is

maintained.

2. | have heard Mr. BM Choudhury, leamed counsel appeanng
on behalf of accused-petitioner, and Mr. NK Kalita, leamed

Additional Public Prosecutor, Assam.

3. The facts leading to the case Is that, Sn J adav Das, Smt. Lahan
Das and Smt. Sewali Devi lodged an FIR on 04-04-2004 in Morngaon
Police Station alleging that the accused persons Sn Upen Deka and
Smt. Sinu Deka are their neighbours and they had received an
amount of Rs. 25,000/-, Rs. 20,000/- and Rs. 30,000/- respectively from
the informants assunng them that they would provide them some
employments in Noonmati Oil Refinary, Guwahati. According to
them, the amount was received as secunty deposits. The aforesaid
three persons, from whom the accused-petitioners took the money,
were taken to Guwahati and a rented house was armanged for their
stay, and thereafter, they were given employment under a local
contractor, astemporary measure. The boys retumed home after one
month as no employment was given to them by the accusedpetitioner, as assured. The accused also did not retum the money to

them on their demand; rather, avoided them on this or that pretext.

4. On the above facts, the aforesaid three persons, namely, Sn
Jadav Das, Smt. Lahan Das and Smt. Sewali Devi filed the FIR with
Mongaon Police Station, which was registered as Mongaon Police
Station Case No. 55/2004, under Sections 420/406 IPC, investigated
into it, collected evidence and then submitted charge-sheet under
Sections 420/406 of the IPC against the accused person. The co
accused named in the FIR, Smt. Sinu Deka, was not charge-sheeted.

5. On appearance of the accused-petitioner, a formal charge,
under Sections 420/406 of the IPC was framed to which he pleaded
Innocence. Therefore, the tnal commenced. In the statement

recorded under Section 313 CrP.C., the accused-petitioner denied

Cri. Rev. Pet. No. 339 of 2007 Page 2 of 6
the allegations made against him and also declined to adduce any

evidence from his side.

6. In this case, the prosecution examined as many as 10
witnesses, which included the Investigating Police Officer and the

defence examined none.

7. The evidence of PW1 is that the accused-petitioner received
an amount of Rs. 25,000/- from him assunng that he would give an
employment to PW1’s son, Raju Das. Although he demanded initially
an amount of Rs. 40,000/-.

8. PW4, Smt. Sandhani Das, wife of PW1, was also present at the
time of transaction between the accused-petitioner and PWI1. The
accused-petitioner took the son of PW1 with other candidates to
Guwahati, kept them in a rented house. After three months, they
went back to theirhomesasno job wasprovided to them as assured.
They were made to work under a contractor only instead of
employment in Oil Refinery. The accused-petitioner also refused to

retum the money taken from PW1.

9. PW2 and PW3 also deposed in the same way that the
accused-petitioner had taken the amount of Rs. 30,000/- and Rs.
10,000/- respectively from them with assurance that he would
arrange employment for the nephew and the son of PW2 and PW3
respectively in Noonmati Oil Refinery. The evidence of PW4 makes it
appear that he has consstently coroborated the evidence of PWs1,
2 and 3. PWs1l, 2 and 3 are also informants In this case and FIR (Ext.1)
wasexhibited through PW1.

10. PW5, Bhogeswar Konwar, also deposed that the accusedpetitioner received an amount of Rs. 20,000/- from him for giving him

job in Noonmati Oil Refinery.

Cri. Rev. Pet. No. 339 of 2007 Page 3 of 6
11. PW/, Rajib Nath, who is the nephew of PW2 is found heard
saying in clear words that the accused-petitioner had taken Rs.
30,000/-, for arranging a job for him at Noonmati Oil Refinery, but did
not provide the job as promised by the accused-petitioner. The
evidence of the aforesaid witnesses remained un-assailed during

Cross-examination.

12. The evidence on record makes it appear that the accusedpetitioner, by taking money from the aforesaid PWs, particulary, PWs
1, 2, 3 and 5 assured them to provide job in Noonmati Oil Refinery
and by not providing job, as assured, he deceived them. He had put
them to believe, in the light of evidence of PWs 1 to 4, that he would
provide the job to them and for that purpose, he received some
money asindicated above. He not only failed to provide job, but also
avoided them when they demanded retum of money. Such conduct
of the accused-petitioner clearly indicates that he deceived the
aforesaid prosecution witnesses, by making false promise. Had he not
dishonestly induced them to part with money or to deliver money to
them, they would not have paid the amount, as aforesaid, to the
accused-petitioner and such act of the accused-petitioner amounts

to cheating asprovided in Section 420 of the IPC.

13. On perusal of the judgment of the leamed tnal Court aswellas
the judgment of the leamed appellate Court, it is clearny found that
the decisions rendered by both the leamed Courts below is based on
the evidence on record and there is no impropnety and illegality in

the judgments.

14. The leamed counsel for the accused-petitioner submitted that
the informants were provided with jobs by the accused-petitioner
under a contractor in the Noonmati Oil Refinery and as such the

promise made by the’ accused-petitioner was effectively

Cri. Rev. Pet. No. 339 of 2007 Page 4 of 6
matenalised, but the fact remains that the PWs 1 to 4 retumed home
back as they were not provided with the jobs in the Oil Refinery and
instead, they were made to work undera contractor there. While the
accused-petitioner assured for providing jobs in the Oil Refinery, it will
definitely mean that they will be provided jobsin the establishment of
Oil Refinery, not under a pnvate contractor. That apart, ‘job’ in the
Instant case, from the tone and tenor of the complaint as well as the

evidence on record, meansregular job with regular salary.

15. Leamed counsel for revision petitioner has submitted that the
promise was not to give a regular job in the Oj Refinery
establishment. At the same time, it hasto be noticed that the promise

wasalso not to provide job undera contractor.

16. That being so, the argument put forward by the leamed
counsel for the revision petitioner, as above, does not ment
consideration giving benefit to the accused-revison petitioner, which

would result in his acquittal.

17. = Inthe considered view of this Court, the judgments and orders
passed by both the Courts below appears to be on the bass of
matenals on record and both the judgments are well wntten with
appropnate legal and logical justification. Therefore, the order of
conviction recorded by the leamed tnal Court as well as confirmed
by leamed appellate Court of Sessions Judge, Mongaon, is

maintained.

18. So faras punishment is concemed, in the considered view of
this Court, the penod already undergone, if imposed as substantive
sentence and if the fine is enhanced to Rs. 15,000/-, it will meet the

ends of justice.

19. It is submitted at the Bar that the accused-petitioner was in

judicial custody dunng the investigation of the case fora penod of

Cri. Rev. Pet. No. 339 of 2007 Page 5 of 6
about 32 days, w.e.f. 10-12-2004 to 12-01-2005, therefore, as stated

This is a Criminal Revision Petition, filed under Section 397 of the

dated 08.10.2007, passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Fast

by the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Cachar, Silchar, in GR Case No. Also heard Mr. NJ Dutta, learned Additional Public Prosecutor, appearing

for the State of Assam. The case of the prosecution is that, on 19.07.2001, at about 7
pm, the injured Subhash Kairi went to visit his kitchen garden. The victim was taken to Silchar Medical College and
Hospital, where he had undergone medical treatment for 1 month and 17
days. Thereafter, his brother lodged the FIR stating therein the cause of
delay in filing the FIR. The Police arrested the accused petitioner,
forwarded him to judicial custody, and after completion of the
investigation, submitted charge-sheet against the accused petitioner, Ashish
Kairi, under Section 326 of the IPC. On appearance of the accused
petitioner, a formal charge under Section 326 of the IPC was framed by the

learned Trial Court, to which the accused petitioner pleaded innocence. In this case, the prosecution examined as many as 6 (six)
witnesses, including the injured/victim and the Investigating Police Officer

as well as the Doctor. PW4 is the vital witness also on the ground that the other
witnesses appeared at the place of occurrence, only after hearing the alarm
raised by the him, and therefore, in the facts and circumstances of the case,
P\W/4/injured is the witness, who can speak about the truth in respect of the

prosecution case. Other non-official witnesses, examined by the prosecution

can speak about the subsequent happenings in the case and as to the state

in which the injured/PW4 was found by them. The PW4 could
identify the accused petitioner as he was holding a torch light at the

relevant point of time. The PW2 in his evidence also deposed that after coming to the
place of occurrence, he found the injured Subhash Kairi there and noticed

that the accused petitioner was fleeing from the place of occurrence. The evidence of PW4 is very specific that the accused petitioner

caused injuries on his person. 3 to 5 may have been caused due to falling upon a
heavy object and other injuries, i.e., injury Nos. 1 and 2, sustained by the
PW4 were grievous in nature caused by sharp object. 338 of 2007 Page 5 of 8

JUDGMENT & ORDER (ORAL)
This is a Criminal Revision Petition, filed under Section 397 of the
Cr.PC, challenging the legality and propriety of the judgment and order,
dated 08.10.2007, passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Fast
Track Court, Cachar, Silchar, in Criminal Appeal No. 11/2007 dismissing the

appeal and upholding the judgment and order, dated 11.07.2007, passed

Cri. Rev. P. No. 338 of 2007 Page 1 of 8
by the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Cachar, Silchar, in GR Case No.
1838/2001, sentencing the accused petitioner to undergo Rigorous
Imprisonment for 3 (three) years and to pay a fine of Rs. 1,000/- , and in
default, Rigorous Imprisonment for 3 (three) months under Section 326 of

the IPC.

2. Heard Mr. IH Laskar, learned counsel for the revision petitioner.
Also heard Mr. NJ Dutta, learned Additional Public Prosecutor, appearing

for the State of Assam.

3. The case of the prosecution is that, on 19.07.2001, at about 7
pm, the injured Subhash Kairi went to visit his kitchen garden. There he was
attacked by the accused/petitioner Ashish Kairi and Ramdulal Kairi,
voluntarily causing grievous hurt to the person of Subhash Kairi by a sharp
cutting weapon. The victim raised hue and cry, following which, nearby
people assembled there and the accused petitioner fled away from the
place of occurrence. The victim was taken to Silchar Medical College and
Hospital, where he had undergone medical treatment for 1 month and 17
days. Thereafter, his brother lodged the FIR stating therein the cause of
delay in filing the FIR. The cause of delay in filing the FIR was attributed to
the fact that the informant was busy in medical treatment of his

brother/injured.

4. On receipt of the FIR, on the above fact, the Dholai Police

Station registered a case, being Dholai Police Station Case No. 134/2001,

Cri. Rev. P. No. 338 of 2007 Page 2 of 8
under Section 326 of the IPC. The Police arrested the accused petitioner,
forwarded him to judicial custody, and after completion of the
investigation, submitted charge-sheet against the accused petitioner, Ashish
Kairi, under Section 326 of the IPC. On appearance of the accused
petitioner, a formal charge under Section 326 of the IPC was framed by the

learned Trial Court, to which the accused petitioner pleaded innocence.

5. In this case, the prosecution examined as many as 6 (six)
witnesses, including the injured/victim and the Investigating Police Officer

as well as the Doctor.

6. After closure of the prosecution witnesses, the statement of the
accused petitioner was recorded under Section 313 of the Cr.PC. In his such
statement, he appears to have denied the accusation levelled against him

and rather pleaded innocence.

7. The learned Trial Court framed a point for determination,
whether the accused petitioner Ashish Kairi, voluntarily caused grievous

injuries to the person of Subhash Kairi/injured with a sharp cutting weapon.

8. In the instant case, the PW/4, being the injured, is the most vital
witness. PW4 is the vital witness also on the ground that the other
witnesses appeared at the place of occurrence, only after hearing the alarm
raised by the him, and therefore, in the facts and circumstances of the case,
P\W/4/injured is the witness, who can speak about the truth in respect of the

prosecution case. Other non-official witnesses, examined by the prosecution

Cri. Rev. P. No. 338 of 2007 Page 3 of 8
can speak about the subsequent happenings in the case and as to the state

in which the injured/PW4 was found by them.

9. The evidence of the PW4 makes it appear that he went to his
kitchen garden at about 7:30 pm on the date of occurrence. The accused
petitioner suddenly appeared there with a dao in his hand and attempted
to inflict a dao blow on his person, which the PW/4 resisted by his left hand,
resulting the blow falling on his palm and adjoining finger area of his left

hand.

10. The learned Trial Court also noticed, on being exhibited, the
little finger of the accused petitioner severed. The evidence of the PW/4 also
reveals that nearby people assembled at the place of occurrence, after
hearing the alarm raised by him, and on arrival, such nearby persons,
immediately took him to the Silchar Medical College and Hospital, where
he had undergone treatment for 1 month and 17 days. The PW4 could
identify the accused petitioner as he was holding a torch light at the

relevant point of time.

11. The PW3, as appears from his evidence, found the injured lying

on the ground on his appearance at the place of occurrence.

12. There is no evidence on record to suggest that there was any
other person with the injured at the relevant point of time, meaning
thereby, that the injured/PW4 is only the best witness to speak about the

person involved in causing injuries to his person.

Cri. Rev. P. No. 338 of 2007 Page 4 of 8
13. PW1 is the informant. He also appeared at the place of
occurrence hearing the alarm raised by the PW4/victim and on his such
appearance at the place of occurrence, he saw the accused petitioner

leaving the place of occurrence with a dao in his hand.

14. The PW2 in his evidence also deposed that after coming to the
place of occurrence, he found the injured Subhash Kairi there and noticed

that the accused petitioner was fleeing from the place of occurrence.

15. The defence cross-examined the aforesaid 4 (four)witnesses, i.e.,
PW/1, PW2, PW3 and PW4, and even during such cross-examination, the
evidence on the core issue, that the PW/4/injured was lying on the ground
with injuries on his person and that PW1, PW2 and PW3 saw the accused

petitioner fleeing from the place of occurrence remained unassailed.

16. The evidence of PW4 is very specific that the accused petitioner

caused injuries on his person.

17. The medical officer, who examined the PW4 has been examined
as PW5 and his evidence is very specific in respect of the injuries. He opined
that the injury Nos. 3 to 5 may have been caused due to falling upon a
heavy object and other injuries, i.e., injury Nos. 1 and 2, sustained by the
PW4 were grievous in nature caused by sharp object. He found amputation
of the left little finger of the person of the victim/PW4 and also opined that
the injuries were fresh at the time of examination of the victim. The injuries

sustained by the PW4/victim, as stated by him in his evidence, received

Cri. Rev. P. No. 338 of 2007 Page 5 of 8
corroboration from the medical evidence of P\W5. The Doctor found the

injuries at SI. Nos. 1 to 3 of his report, simple and lacerated.

18. The weapon of offence, i.e., the dao was recovered from the
house of the accused petitioner and was seized by the Investigating Police
Officer after four days from the date of occurrence. So, the consistent
evidence and corroborative evidence of PWs, particularly the evidence of
PW4, leaves no doubt in the mind of this Court, that it was none but the
accused petitioner who had committed the offence of causing grievous hurt

on the person of the PW4.

19. The learned counsel for the petitioner, during the course of
hearing, has argued that the dao recovered from the house of the accused
petitioner, was without blood stain, and as such, it could not be said that
the seized dao was used by the accused petitioner in the commission of the

alleged offence.

20. But the learned Trial Court as well as the learned Appellate Court
of Additional Sessions Judge has taken care of this argument made by the
learned counsel for the petitioner, and indicated in both the judgments that
it is unlikely to get blood in the seized dao, in view of the fact that the

same was seized after four days from the date of occurrence.

21. The learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that the

torch light, which was used by the PW4/injured at the relevant point of

Cri. Rev. P. No. 338 of 2007 Page 6 of 8
time and which helped him in identifying the accused petitioner was not

seized by the Police.

22. In the considered view of this Court, this does not affect the
consistent evidence of the witnesses and the seizure or non-seizure of the

said torch light will have no bearing in ascertaining the fact of the case.

23. Assuming for a moment that seizure of the torch light would
have some bearing in the case, yet for inaction or improper action on the
part of the Investigating Police Officer, no fault could be found with the
injured. Lapse in the investigation cannot be allowed to take decisive

position for holding a prosecution story, true or untrue.

24. In view of the above discussions, it does not appear that the
concurrent finding of the learned Trial Court and the learned Appellate
Court of the Additional Sessions Judge, need interference by this Court, in
exercise of its revisional power, as decisions rendered by both the Courts
below are based on evidence on record. Therefore, the order of conviction

of the accused petitioner is upheld .

25. The case was initially filed in the year 2001, the judgment was
delivered by the learned Trial Court on 11.07.2007 and then by the learned
Appellate Court of the Additional Sessions Judge on 08.10.2007 and
thereafter, the case is before this High Court by way of this revision
petition, challenging the legality and propriety of the judgments and order

passed by the learned Courts below.

Cri. Rev. P. No. 338 of 2007 Page 7 of 8
26. It has already been found that the judgments passed by the
learned Courts Below are based on evidence on record and need no
interference, so far the findings recorded by the learned Trial Court and the

learned Appellate Court of Additional Sessions Judge is concerned.

27. As far as the sentence is concerned, in the considered view of this
Court, considering the background, facts of the case, the substantive
sentence is reduced from Rigorous Imprisonment of 3 (three) years to 1
(One) year and the fine is enhanced to Rs. 3,000/-. Accordingly, the accused
petitioner is sentenced to Rigorous Imprisonment for 1 (one) year and a
fine of Rs. 3,000/-, and in default of payment of fine, to suffer Rigorous

Imprisonment for another 3 (three) months.

28. Accordingly, the revision petition is partly allowed.

29. The accused revision petitioner will surrender before the learned
Trial Court for serving the sentence within one month from today. The
period of detention of the revision petitioner in custody during

investigation and trial, if any, is set off against the aforesaid sentence.

30. Send down the LCR along with the copy of this judgment.

for the State of Assam.

3. The case of the prosecution is that, on 19.07.2001, at about 7
pm, the injured Subhash Kairi went to visit his kitchen garden. There he was
attacked by the accused/petitioner Ashish Kairi and Ramdulal Kairi,
voluntarily causing grievous hurt to the person of Subhash Kairi by a sharp
cutting weapon. The victim raised hue and cry, following which, nearby
people assembled there and the accused petitioner fled away from the
place of occurrence. The victim was taken to Silchar Medical College and
Hospital, where he had undergone medical treatment for 1 month and 17
days. Thereafter, his brother lodged the FIR stating therein the cause of
delay in filing the FIR. The cause of delay in filing the FIR was attributed to
the fact that the informant was busy in medical treatment of his

brother/injured.

4. On receipt of the FIR, on the above fact, the Dholai Police

Station registered a case, being Dholai Police Station Case No. 134/2001,

Cri. Rev. P. No. 338 of 2007 Page 2 of 8
under Section 326 of the IPC. The Police arrested the accused petitioner,
forwarded him to judicial custody, and after completion of the
investigation, submitted charge-sheet against the accused petitioner, Ashish
Kairi, under Section 326 of the IPC. On appearance of the accused
petitioner, a formal charge under Section 326 of the IPC was framed by the

learned Trial Court, to which the accused petitioner pleaded innocence.

5. In this case, the prosecution examined as many as 6 (six)
witnesses, including the injured/victim and the Investigating Police Officer

as well as the Doctor.

6. After closure of the prosecution witnesses, the statement of the
accused petitioner was recorded under Section 313 of the Cr.PC. In his such
statement, he appears to have denied the accusation levelled against him

and rather pleaded innocence.

7. The learned Trial Court framed a point for determination,
whether the accused petitioner Ashish Kairi, voluntarily caused grievous

injuries to the person of Subhash Kairi/injured with a sharp cutting weapon.

8. In the instant case, the PW/4, being the injured, is the most vital
witness. PW4 is the vital witness also on the ground that the other
witnesses appeared at the place of occurrence, only after hearing the alarm
raised by the him, and therefore, in the facts and circumstances of the case,
P\W/4/injured is the witness, who can speak about the truth in respect of the

prosecution case. Other non-official witnesses, examined by the prosecution

Cri. Rev. P. No. 338 of 2007 Page 3 of 8
can speak about the subsequent happenings in the case and as to the state

in which the injured/PW4 was found by them.

9. The evidence of the PW4 makes it appear that he went to his
kitchen garden at about 7:30 pm on the date of occurrence. The accused
petitioner suddenly appeared there with a dao in his hand and attempted
to inflict a dao blow on his person, which the PW/4 resisted by his left hand,
resulting the blow falling on his palm and adjoining finger area of his left

hand.

10. The learned Trial Court also noticed, on being exhibited, the
little finger of the accused petitioner severed. The evidence of the PW/4 also
reveals that nearby people assembled at the place of occurrence, after
hearing the alarm raised by him, and on arrival, such nearby persons,
immediately took him to the Silchar Medical College and Hospital, where
he had undergone treatment for 1 month and 17 days. The PW4 could
identify the accused petitioner as he was holding a torch light at the

relevant point of time.

11. The PW3, as appears from his evidence, found the injured lying

on the ground on his appearance at the place of occurrence.

12. There is no evidence on record to suggest that there was any
other person with the injured at the relevant point of time, meaning
thereby, that the injured/PW4 is only the best witness to speak about the

person involved in causing injuries to his person.

Cri. Rev. P. No. 338 of 2007 Page 4 of 8
13. PW1 is the informant. He also appeared at the place of
occurrence hearing the alarm raised by the PW4/victim and on his such
appearance at the place of occurrence, he saw the accused petitioner

leaving the place of occurrence with a dao in his hand.

14. The PW2 in his evidence also deposed that after coming to the
place of occurrence, he found the injured Subhash Kairi there and noticed

that the accused petitioner was fleeing from the place of occurrence.

15. The defence cross-examined the aforesaid 4 (four)witnesses, i.e.,
PW/1, PW2, PW3 and PW4, and even during such cross-examination, the
evidence on the core issue, that the PW/4/injured was lying on the ground
with injuries on his person and that PW1, PW2 and PW3 saw the accused

petitioner fleeing from the place of occurrence remained unassailed.

16. The evidence of PW4 is very specific that the accused petitioner

caused injuries on his person.

17. The medical officer, who examined the PW4 has been examined
as PW5 and his evidence is very specific in respect of the injuries. He opined
that the injury Nos. 3 to 5 may have been caused due to falling upon a
heavy object and other injuries, i.e., injury Nos. 1 and 2, sustained by the
PW4 were grievous in nature caused by sharp object. He found amputation
of the left little finger of the person of the victim/PW4 and also opined that
the injuries were fresh at the time of examination of the victim. The injuries

sustained by the PW4/victim, as stated by him in his evidence, received

Cri. Rev. P. No. 338 of 2007 Page 5 of 8
corroboration from the medical evidence of P\W5. The Doctor found the

injuries at SI. Nos. 1 to 3 of his report, simple and lacerated.

18. The weapon of offence, i.e., the dao was recovered from the
house of the accused petitioner and was seized by the Investigating Police
Officer after four days from the date of occurrence. So, the consistent
evidence and corroborative evidence of PWs, particularly the evidence of
PW4, leaves no doubt in the mind of this Court, that it was none but the
accused petitioner who had committed the offence of causing grievous hurt

on the person of the PW4.

19. The learned counsel for the petitioner, during the course of
hearing, has argued that the dao recovered from the house of the accused
petitioner, was without blood stain, and as such, it could not be said that
the seized dao was used by the accused petitioner in the commission of the

alleged offence.

20. But the learned Trial Court as well as the learned Appellate Court
of Additional Sessions Judge has taken care of this argument made by the
learned counsel for the petitioner, and indicated in both the judgments that
it is unlikely to get blood in the seized dao, in view of the fact that the

same was seized after four days from the date of occurrence.

21. The learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that the

torch light, which was used by the PW4/injured at the relevant point of

Cri. Rev. P. No. 338 of 2007 Page 6 of 8
time and which helped him in identifying the accused petitioner was not

seized by the Police.

22. In the considered view of this Court, this does not affect the
consistent evidence of the witnesses and the seizure or non-seizure of the

said torch light will have no bearing in ascertaining the fact of the case.

23. Assuming for a moment that seizure of the torch light would
have some bearing in the case, yet for inaction or improper action on the
part of the Investigating Police Officer, no fault could be found with the
injured. Lapse in the investigation cannot be allowed to take decisive

position for holding a prosecution story, true or untrue.

24. In view of the above discussions, it does not appear that the
concurrent finding of the learned Trial Court and the learned Appellate
Court of the Additional Sessions Judge, need interference by this Court, in
exercise of its revisional power, as decisions rendered by both the Courts
below are based on evidence on record. Therefore, the order of conviction

of the accused petitioner is upheld .

25. The case was initially filed in the year 2001, the judgment was
delivered by the learned Trial Court on 11.07.2007 and then by the learned
Appellate Court of the Additional Sessions Judge on 08.10.2007 and
thereafter, the case is before this High Court by way of this revision
petition, challenging the legality and propriety of the judgments and order

passed by the learned Courts below.

Cri. Rev. P. No. 338 of 2007 Page 7 of 8
26. It has already been found that the judgments passed by the
learned Courts Below are based on evidence on record and need no
interference, so far the findings recorded by the learned Trial Court and the

learned Appellate Court of Additional Sessions Judge is concerned.

27. As far as the sentence is concerned, in the considered view of this
Court, considering the background, facts of the case, the substantive
sentence is reduced from Rigorous Imprisonment of 3 (three) years to 1
(One) year and the fine is enhanced to Rs. 3,000/-. Accordingly, the accused
petitioner is sentenced to Rigorous Imprisonment for 1 (one) year and a
fine of Rs. 3,000/-, and in default of payment of fine, to suffer Rigorous

Imprisonment for another 3 (three) months.

28. Accordingly, the revision petition is partly allowed.

29. The accused revision petitioner will surrender before the learned
Trial Court for serving the sentence within one month from today. The
period of detention of the revision petitioner in custody during

investigation and trial, if any, is set off against the aforesaid sentence.

30. Send down the LCR along with the copy of this judgment.

JUDGMENT AND ORDER (Oral)

The Criminal Revision Petition, before this court, is filed challenging the
legality and propriety of the judgment and order, dated 4.1.2007, passed by the
learned Assistant Sessions Judge, Golaghat, convicting and sentencing the
accused revision petitioners to rigorous imprisonment for 5 years and a fine of
Rs. 5,000/-, in default, rigorous imprisonment for another 1 month as well as the
judgment and order, dated 5.9.2007, passed by the learned Sessions Judge,

Imposed upon both the accused revision petitioners by the learned trial court.

Page 1 of 7
Crl.Rev.P.355/2007
2) Heard Mr. A Choudhury, learned counsel for the revision petitioner as well

as Mr. N K Kalita, learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the state.

3) The case of the prosecution is that, on 26.10.200 at about 6:30 pm, while
the victim, Smti. Sarifa Begum, was standing in front of her residence, the
accused revision petitioners appeared there in a Maruti Van and forcibly took her
Into the van, and then, left towards Nagaon. One Md. Rajib Ali witnessed the
occurrence, and he, in no time, informed the father of the victim Md. Rezzak Ali
about the occurrence. The father of the victim, aforesaid, and Rezzak,
immediately, in another car, followed the Maruti Van and could found the same
In front of a restaurant at Jokholabandha. Then, with the help of the police
there, he apprehended the driver of the vehicle, and on being led by the driver of
the victim, i.e. the accused petitioner Milan Bora, recovered the accused revision
petitioner Sahidur Rahman and the victim girl from a nearby house. Then, the
aforesaid and Rezzak lodged the FIR. Both the accused revision petitioners and

the victim were taken to J okholabandha Police Station.

4) On receipt of the FIR, Bokakhat Police Station registered a case being No.
104/1998, under Section 366 IPC, investigated into it, arrested the accused
persons, got recorded the statements of the victim under Section 164 Cr.PC, and
finally, submitted charge-sheet against the accused revision petitioners under
Section 366 IPC.

5) The learned trial court of Assistant Sessions Judge, Golaghat, after
exhausting all the required formalities, framed a formal charge against the
accused revision petitioners under Section 366/34 IPC. Both the accused
revision petitioners pleaded innocence while the charge was read over and

explained to them, and, therefore, the trial commenced.

6) The issue for decision in the facts of the case is, whether the accused
revision petitioners kidnapped or abducted the victim Sarifa Begum with intent
that she might be compelled or knowing it to be likely that she would be

compelled to marry another person against her will.

7) In the considered view of this court, issue for determination mentioned

above, covers one of the component of Section 366 IPC, and not the remaining

Page 2 of 7
Crl.Rev.P.355/2007
components, considering the background facts of the case, as there is no
accusation in respect of illicit intercourse etc. and as the findings available in the
record makes it look like a case of abducting the victim to marry one of the

accused revision petitioners Sahidur Rahman.

8) For the determination of the above noted point, the prosecution
examined as many as 6 (six) witnesses who were subjected to cross-examination

by the defence.

9) The incriminating evidence appearing against the accused revision
petitioners were brought to the notice while recording their statements under
Section 313 Cr.PC. The accused revision petitioners denied the accusations
made against them. In their such statements, both the accused revision

petitioners also declined to lead any defence evidence.

10) In view of the above, let us now scan the evidence on record to find out
whether the prosecution has been able to bring home the accusation against the

accused revision petitioners.

11) PW1, Sarifa Begum, is the victim in this case. The victim, in her
evidence, is heard saying that at the time of occurrence, she was forcibly picked
up by the accused revision petitioners from in front of her house. She was
waiting for her father there. In her statement under Section 164 Cr.PC, which is
exhibited, vide Ext.1, she is heard saying that she was waiting for her brother to
come. At that time, she was picked up in a Maruti Van by the accused revision
petitioners. She has also very categorical in her evidence on oath before the
learned trial court as PW1 as well as in her statement recorded under Section
164 Cr.PC that as soon as she was put inside the Maruti Van, she was gagged
with a cloth preventing her from shouting and raising alarm. The further
evidence of the PW1/victim is that, once while she was coming in a bus from
Bokakaht to Nagaon with her mother, the accused revision petitioner, Sahidur
Rahman, got introduced himself with them and told her mother that he wanted
to marry the victim Sarifa Begum. The mother of the victim then told him to
send is parents to their house. But, instead of his parents, accused revision

petitioner Sahidur Rahman himself went to the house of the victim, and they

Page 3 of 7
Crl.Rev.P.355/2007
refused to give her in marriage with him after coming to know that he was
already a married person with children. The incident of kidnapping/abduction of
the victim occurred after the refusal to give her in marriage with the accused
revision petitioner Sahidur Rahman. The fact of refusal on the part of the
parents of the victim to give their daughter/victim Safira Begum in marriage with
the accused revision petitioner Sahidur Rahman remain unassailed even during
the cross-examination of the victim. The evidence of PW3 appears to be very
Important in the case in the sense that he is the eyewitness of picking up of the
victim by the accused revision petitioners in the Maruti Van. In his evidence, he
IS very specific while stating that he saw that the victim was taken inside the
Maruti Van, and even, he remembers the number of the Maruti Van. The
Registration No. of Maruti Van is AS-02/4668. It has come out from his evidence
that immediately on seeing that the victin/yPW1 was taken inside the vehicle,
aforesaid, he informed PW2, the father of the victim Md. Rezzak. Then himself
with PW2 followed the Maruti Van in another vehicle to catch the accused and
the driver was apprehended Milan Bora in a restaurant at J okhlobandha, and
then, on being led by him, apprehended the accused revision petitioner Sahidur
Rahman along with the victim in a nearby house. Such evidence of the PW3,
received absolute corroboration from the evidence of the PW2/informant as well
as the father of the victim PW1. PW2 deposed that on being told to him by the
PW3, he followed the Maruti Van carrying his daughter/victim by another vehicle
along with PW3 and another and nabbed one of the accused revision petitioners
Milan Bora at J okholabandha restaurant, and thereafter, on being led by him, his
daughter/victim and the accused Sahidur Rahman were apprehended from a
nearby house. PWA4 is heard saying in his evidence that he was busy in his shop
nearby the place of occurrence he being the shopkeeper and that he only saw
the victim boarding in a Maruti Van. The evidence of PW5 is that he also saw
PW2 and PW3 while following the Maruti Van carrying the daughter of the PW2,
as he was a part of the team which followed the Maruti Van taking away the
victim from the place of occurrence. His evidence corroborates with the evidence
of PW2 and PW3 so far the fact of recovery of the victim is concerned. PW6 is
the Investigating Police Officer. His evidence is of formal character. His

evidence relates to investigation of the case and its various stages including

Page 4of 7
Crl.Rev.P.355/2007
recording of the statement of the victim under Section 164 Cr.PC, recording
statements of the witnesses as well as the arrest of the accused revision
petitioners till submission of the charge-sheet against the accused revision

petitioners.

12) In view of the consistent and corroborative evidence of the witnesses,
referred to above, it appears that the prosecution has been able to prove that

the victim was kidnapped/abducated.

13) — The learned counsel for the accused revision petitioners referred to a
decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Fa/yas Ahmed & Ors. -vs- State of
Bthar reported in 191 Supp (1) Supreme Court Cases 186, and pointed out
that, like in the facts of the above said decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, in
the instant case also, there is no evidence on record to show that the victim was
abducted or kidnapped to compel her either to marry against her wish or to
Subject her to sexual intercourse against her wish. On such finding, the accused
was acquitted of the charge under Section 366 of the IPC in the case referred to
above. But, in the instant case the fact is not similar to that of one referred to in
the decision above. None of the witnesses, including the victim are found to
have deposed in their evidence before the court that after kidnapping her, there
was no attempt to marry her against her will and sexual intercourse is also not
alleged. But, the fact remains that the accused revision petitioner Sahidur
Rahman proposed to marry the victim girl sometime back and on being refused
on the ground that he is already a married person having children, he had
abducted her, and as such, it is implied that taking away the victim girl was with
the intention of marrying her. The further fact is that the victim was recovered
within 1 (one) hour of taking her away by the accused revision petitioners, and,
during this 1 (one) hour, they travelled a lot, and as such, to marry her against
her will or to detain her with such intention would have arisen had she not been
recovered within 1 (one) hour of the occurrence. The fact of the case so far
kidnapping of the victim on the date of occurrence is concerned, cannot be read
In isolation with the fact that his proposal to marry her was refused by the
parents of the victim on the ground stated above. Learned counsel for the

revision petitioners has also referred to a decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court

Page 5 of 7
Crl.Rev.P.355/2007
in Gabbu -vs- State of M.P. reported in (2006) 5 Supreme Court Cases
740, and pointed out to this court, with reference to the contents of paragraph-5
therein, that the victim did not raise alarm while she was abducted. The Hon'ble
Supreme Court found justification in not raising alarm by the victim in the above

case. Paragraph-5 of the said decision is quoted below :

“5. The High court held that nothing is brought in the crossexamination of the prosecutrix whereby the story of the inadent
narrated by her, should not be believed. The story given by her
IS telltale and does not create any doubt about all what has been
sald by her. The argument that normally a person will raise a cry
when he Is being forcibly taken away, was dealt with by the High
Court by recording a finding that she aid not raise alarm as she
was frightened and it was to be borne in mind that she was an
Iiterate., rural and rustic village lady who would believe in
superstitions, more particularly when in 10 years’ married life she
did not have a child and accused-appellant Gabbu had promised
her that he would do something by which she would have a
Child. The tribe to which the prosecutnx belonged is Known to
believe in superstitions. The High Court observed that it was not
Impossible that because of the fear she did not raise any Cry,
more particularly when she was taken away to a place unkown to

Ml

her.

14) It appears from the above that the fact of that case and the fact of the
Instant case is completely different. In the case referred to by the learned
counsel for the revision petitioner above was in respect of a married woman who
did not have a child for 10 years, and, in the instant case, the victim is said to be
a girl of 16 years of age, and in her evidence she Is categorical that she could not
raise alarm because she was gagged with a cloth by the accused revision

petitioners.
15) — This is not a case that there is no explanation for not raising alarm, but

there is an explanation given by the victim in her evidence which does not

Page 6 of 7
Crl.Rev.P.355/2007
appear to have been assailed by the defence and which this court belies to be

true in the given facts of the case.

16) — That being so, the said two decisions, referred to by the learned counsel
for the revision petitioners, do not appear to be of any helf to the defence and

the facts and circumstances of the case at hand.

17) = The judgment of the learned trial court of Assistant Sessions J udge,
Golaghat, and the judgment in appeal, passed by the learned Sessions J udge,
Golaghat, are found to have been based on the evidence on record requiring no
Interference by this court in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction so far the

conviction is concerned.

18) Considering the fact that the victim was apprehended within 1 hour after
the occurrence and there was no caused harm to her person during her captivity
as well as the fact that the occurrence in the instant case took place in the year
1998, and that the accused revision petitioners have fought a prolonged legal
battle till date, in the considered view of this court, if the substantive sentence is
reduced to the period already undergone, and the fine of Rs. 5,000/- imposed by
the learned courts below is enhanced to Rs. 15,000/- each, will meet the ends of

justice.

19) Accordingly, the substantive sentence imposed upon the accused revision
petitioners is reduced to the period already undergone, and, the fine imposed
upon them is enhanced to Rs. 15,000/- each, in default, 1 month rigorous

Imprisonment each.
20) — This Criminal Revision Petition stands disposed of accordingly.
21) Send back the LCR along with a copy of this judgment.

22) The accused petitioners are directed to surrender before the learned trial

court within 1 (one) month of this order to serve out the sentence.

Crl.Rev.P.355/2007
2) Heard Mr. A Choudhury, learned counsel for the revision petitioner as well

as Mr. N K Kalita, learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the state.

3) The case of the prosecution is that, on 26.10.200 at about 6:30 pm, while
the victim, Smti. Sarifa Begum, was standing in front of her residence, the
accused revision petitioners appeared there in a Maruti Van and forcibly took her
Into the van, and then, left towards Nagaon. One Md. Rajib Ali witnessed the
occurrence, and he, in no time, informed the father of the victim Md. Rezzak Ali
about the occurrence. The father of the victim, aforesaid, and Rezzak,
immediately, in another car, followed the Maruti Van and could found the same
In front of a restaurant at Jokholabandha. Then, with the help of the police
there, he apprehended the driver of the vehicle, and on being led by the driver of
the victim, i.e. the accused petitioner Milan Bora, recovered the accused revision
petitioner Sahidur Rahman and the victim girl from a nearby house. Then, the
aforesaid and Rezzak lodged the FIR. Both the accused revision petitioners and

the victim were taken to J okholabandha Police Station.

4) On receipt of the FIR, Bokakhat Police Station registered a case being No.
104/1998, under Section 366 IPC, investigated into it, arrested the accused
persons, got recorded the statements of the victim under Section 164 Cr.PC, and
finally, submitted charge-sheet against the accused revision petitioners under
Section 366 IPC.

5) The learned trial court of Assistant Sessions Judge, Golaghat, after
exhausting all the required formalities, framed a formal charge against the
accused revision petitioners under Section 366/34 IPC. Both the accused
revision petitioners pleaded innocence while the charge was read over and

explained to them, and, therefore, the trial commenced.

6) The issue for decision in the facts of the case is, whether the accused
revision petitioners kidnapped or abducted the victim Sarifa Begum with intent
that she might be compelled or knowing it to be likely that she would be

compelled to marry another person against her will.

7) In the considered view of this court, issue for determination mentioned

above, covers one of the component of Section 366 IPC, and not the remaining

Page 2 of 7
Crl.Rev.P.355/2007
components, considering the background facts of the case, as there is no
accusation in respect of illicit intercourse etc. and as the findings available in the
record makes it look like a case of abducting the victim to marry one of the

accused revision petitioners Sahidur Rahman.

8) For the determination of the above noted point, the prosecution
examined as many as 6 (six) witnesses who were subjected to cross-examination

by the defence.

9) The incriminating evidence appearing against the accused revision
petitioners were brought to the notice while recording their statements under
Section 313 Cr.PC. The accused revision petitioners denied the accusations
made against them. In their such statements, both the accused revision

petitioners also declined to lead any defence evidence.

10) In view of the above, let us now scan the evidence on record to find out
whether the prosecution has been able to bring home the accusation against the

accused revision petitioners.

11) PW1, Sarifa Begum, is the victim in this case. The victim, in her
evidence, is heard saying that at the time of occurrence, she was forcibly picked
up by the accused revision petitioners from in front of her house. She was
waiting for her father there. In her statement under Section 164 Cr.PC, which is
exhibited, vide Ext.1, she is heard saying that she was waiting for her brother to
come. At that time, she was picked up in a Maruti Van by the accused revision
petitioners. She has also very categorical in her evidence on oath before the
learned trial court as PW1 as well as in her statement recorded under Section
164 Cr.PC that as soon as she was put inside the Maruti Van, she was gagged
with a cloth preventing her from shouting and raising alarm. The further
evidence of the PW1/victim is that, once while she was coming in a bus from
Bokakaht to Nagaon with her mother, the accused revision petitioner, Sahidur
Rahman, got introduced himself with them and told her mother that he wanted
to marry the victim Sarifa Begum. The mother of the victim then told him to
send is parents to their house. But, instead of his parents, accused revision

petitioner Sahidur Rahman himself went to the house of the victim, and they

Page 3 of 7
Crl.Rev.P.355/2007
refused to give her in marriage with him after coming to know that he was
already a married person with children. The incident of kidnapping/abduction of
the victim occurred after the refusal to give her in marriage with the accused
revision petitioner Sahidur Rahman. The fact of refusal on the part of the
parents of the victim to give their daughter/victim Safira Begum in marriage with
the accused revision petitioner Sahidur Rahman remain unassailed even during
the cross-examination of the victim. The evidence of PW3 appears to be very
Important in the case in the sense that he is the eyewitness of picking up of the
victim by the accused revision petitioners in the Maruti Van. In his evidence, he
IS very specific while stating that he saw that the victim was taken inside the
Maruti Van, and even, he remembers the number of the Maruti Van. The
Registration No. of Maruti Van is AS-02/4668. It has come out from his evidence
that immediately on seeing that the victin/yPW1 was taken inside the vehicle,
aforesaid, he informed PW2, the father of the victim Md. Rezzak. Then himself
with PW2 followed the Maruti Van in another vehicle to catch the accused and
the driver was apprehended Milan Bora in a restaurant at J okhlobandha, and
then, on being led by him, apprehended the accused revision petitioner Sahidur
Rahman along with the victim in a nearby house. Such evidence of the PW3,
received absolute corroboration from the evidence of the PW2/informant as well
as the father of the victim PW1. PW2 deposed that on being told to him by the
PW3, he followed the Maruti Van carrying his daughter/victim by another vehicle
along with PW3 and another and nabbed one of the accused revision petitioners
Milan Bora at J okholabandha restaurant, and thereafter, on being led by him, his
daughter/victim and the accused Sahidur Rahman were apprehended from a
nearby house. PWA4 is heard saying in his evidence that he was busy in his shop
nearby the place of occurrence he being the shopkeeper and that he only saw
the victim boarding in a Maruti Van. The evidence of PW5 is that he also saw
PW2 and PW3 while following the Maruti Van carrying the daughter of the PW2,
as he was a part of the team which followed the Maruti Van taking away the
victim from the place of occurrence. His evidence corroborates with the evidence
of PW2 and PW3 so far the fact of recovery of the victim is concerned. PW6 is
the Investigating Police Officer. His evidence is of formal character. His

evidence relates to investigation of the case and its various stages including

Page 4of 7
Crl.Rev.P.355/2007
recording of the statement of the victim under Section 164 Cr.PC, recording
statements of the witnesses as well as the arrest of the accused revision
petitioners till submission of the charge-sheet against the accused revision

petitioners.

12) In view of the consistent and corroborative evidence of the witnesses,
referred to above, it appears that the prosecution has been able to prove that

the victim was kidnapped/abducated.

13) — The learned counsel for the accused revision petitioners referred to a
decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Fa/yas Ahmed & Ors. -vs- State of
Bthar reported in 191 Supp (1) Supreme Court Cases 186, and pointed out
that, like in the facts of the above said decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, in
the instant case also, there is no evidence on record to show that the victim was
abducted or kidnapped to compel her either to marry against her wish or to
Subject her to sexual intercourse against her wish. On such finding, the accused
was acquitted of the charge under Section 366 of the IPC in the case referred to
above. But, in the instant case the fact is not similar to that of one referred to in
the decision above. None of the witnesses, including the victim are found to
have deposed in their evidence before the court that after kidnapping her, there
was no attempt to marry her against her will and sexual intercourse is also not
alleged. But, the fact remains that the accused revision petitioner Sahidur
Rahman proposed to marry the victim girl sometime back and on being refused
on the ground that he is already a married person having children, he had
abducted her, and as such, it is implied that taking away the victim girl was with
the intention of marrying her. The further fact is that the victim was recovered
within 1 (one) hour of taking her away by the accused revision petitioners, and,
during this 1 (one) hour, they travelled a lot, and as such, to marry her against
her will or to detain her with such intention would have arisen had she not been
recovered within 1 (one) hour of the occurrence. The fact of the case so far
kidnapping of the victim on the date of occurrence is concerned, cannot be read
In isolation with the fact that his proposal to marry her was refused by the
parents of the victim on the ground stated above. Learned counsel for the

revision petitioners has also referred to a decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court

Page 5 of 7
Crl.Rev.P.355/2007
in Gabbu -vs- State of M.P. reported in (2006) 5 Supreme Court Cases
740, and pointed out to this court, with reference to the contents of paragraph-5
therein, that the victim did not raise alarm while she was abducted. The Hon'ble
Supreme Court found justification in not raising alarm by the victim in the above

case. Paragraph-5 of the said decision is quoted below :

“5. The High court held that nothing is brought in the crossexamination of the prosecutrix whereby the story of the inadent
narrated by her, should not be believed. The story given by her
IS telltale and does not create any doubt about all what has been
sald by her. The argument that normally a person will raise a cry
when he Is being forcibly taken away, was dealt with by the High
Court by recording a finding that she aid not raise alarm as she
was frightened and it was to be borne in mind that she was an
Iiterate., rural and rustic village lady who would believe in
superstitions, more particularly when in 10 years’ married life she
did not have a child and accused-appellant Gabbu had promised
her that he would do something by which she would have a
Child. The tribe to which the prosecutnx belonged is Known to
believe in superstitions. The High Court observed that it was not
Impossible that because of the fear she did not raise any Cry,
more particularly when she was taken away to a place unkown to

Ml

her.

14) It appears from the above that the fact of that case and the fact of the
Instant case is completely different. In the case referred to by the learned
counsel for the revision petitioner above was in respect of a married woman who
did not have a child for 10 years, and, in the instant case, the victim is said to be
a girl of 16 years of age, and in her evidence she Is categorical that she could not
raise alarm because she was gagged with a cloth by the accused revision

petitioners.
15) — This is not a case that there is no explanation for not raising alarm, but

there is an explanation given by the victim in her evidence which does not

Page 6 of 7
Crl.Rev.P.355/2007
appear to have been assailed by the defence and which this court belies to be

true in the given facts of the case.

16) — That being so, the said two decisions, referred to by the learned counsel
for the revision petitioners, do not appear to be of any helf to the defence and

the facts and circumstances of the case at hand.

17) = The judgment of the learned trial court of Assistant Sessions J udge,
Golaghat, and the judgment in appeal, passed by the learned Sessions J udge,
Golaghat, are found to have been based on the evidence on record requiring no
Interference by this court in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction so far the

conviction is concerned.

18) Considering the fact that the victim was apprehended within 1 hour after
the occurrence and there was no caused harm to her person during her captivity
as well as the fact that the occurrence in the instant case took place in the year
1998, and that the accused revision petitioners have fought a prolonged legal
battle till date, in the considered view of this court, if the substantive sentence is
reduced to the period already undergone, and the fine of Rs. 5,000/- imposed by
the learned courts below is enhanced to Rs. 15,000/- each, will meet the ends of

justice.

19) Accordingly, the substantive sentence imposed upon the accused revision
petitioners is reduced to the period already undergone, and, the fine imposed
upon them is enhanced to Rs. 15,000/- each, in default, 1 month rigorous

Imprisonment each.
20) — This Criminal Revision Petition stands disposed of accordingly.
21) Send back the LCR along with a copy of this judgment.

22) The accused petitioners are directed to surrender before the learned trial

court within 1 (one) month of this order to serve out the sentence.

This Criminal Revision Petition before this court is challenging the legality

71/2007, setting aside the judgment and order, dated 27.3.2007, passed by the

Section 125 Cr.PC, granting monthly maintenance allowance of Rs. 1,000/- to

the present petitioner.

Page 1 of 4

2) Heard Mr. T H Hazariak, learned counsel for the petitioner. None
appears for the respondent. This is an old pending Criminal Revision Petition of
the year 2007. Therefore, it has been taken up for disposal on merit on perusal
of the evidence recorded by the learned trial court as well as on perusal of the
judgments of the learned courts below including the Revision Petition and the

grounds taken therein.

3) A proceeding, under Section 125 Cr.PC, was initiated by the present
petitioner, Sabita Deka, against the present respondent, Babul Deka, before the
learned Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Rangia, claiming monthly
maintenance allowance from the respondent. According to her, on 30.3.2006,
the respondent married her by executing a registered agreement at Guwahati,
and, after the agreement was executed, he had put vermilion on her forehead
accepting her as his wife in presence of village people, and thereafter, she was
taken to his house. There, she stayed for 4 days, and after subjecting her to
torture, the present respondent drove her out of his house on 4.4.2006,
following which, she lodged an FIR with the Baihata Chariali Police Station vide
Case No. 86/2006, under Section 498(A) IPC. The brother and sister of the
present respondent threatened her not to come back to their house. Since then,

the respondent has not been providing any maintenance allowance to her.

4) The respondent contested the proceeding before the learned trial court by
filing written statement, denying the marriage and claiming that the present

petitioner is not his wife and is not entitled to any maintenance allowance.

5) The learned trial court appears to have thoroughly discussed the evidence
on record and found that there is a marriage agreement between both the
parties. On the date of execution of the registered agreement itself, the
respondent took her to his house after putting vermilion on her forehead,
meaning thereby, he had accepted her as his wife from that day itself. |The
present petitioner also claimed, before the learned trial court, that she stayed at

Page 2 of 4
Crl.Rev.P.366/2007
the residence of the respondent as husband and wife for 4 days, and thereafter,

she was driven out by the mother, brother and sister of the respondent.

6) In the defence evidence, it is found that the respondent himself, examined
as DW1, admitted the execution of the marriage agreement between him and the
present petitioner. Although he had taken a plea that his signature in the
marriage agreement had been obtained forcibly. He has admitted that though
his signature was taken forcibly without his consent, he had not filed any
complaint anywhere. In his cross-examination, DW1 has admitted that there is
no statement in the agreement that the marriage between them will take place
subsequently. Therefore, it appears that from the date of execution of the
agreement, he had accepted the present petitioner as his wife and, this fact is
further substantiated by the fact that he had put vermilion on the forehead of

the present petitioner, meaning thereby, that he had married her.

7) Learned counsel for the petitioner has also referred to the decision of the
Hon’ble Supreme Court in Savitaben Somabhai Bhatiya —-vs- State of Gujarat &
Others reported in (2005) 3 Supreme Court Cases 636. He has referred to
paragraph-13 of the said judgment specifically and submitted that the execution
of the marriage agreement and putting vermilion on the forehead of the present
petitioner by the respondent, the marriage procedure was followed, and as such,
it is not necessary for the petitioner to prove further as to whether the said
procedure was completed as per Hindu rites, in a proceeding under Section 125

Cr.PC.

8) It is an admitted position that the proceeding before this court is under
Section 125 Cr.PC. There is also no dispute to the effect that the respondent was
a tutor of the present petitioner and they had developed love between them
during that period, resulting in execution of the marriage agreement followed by
putting vermilion on her forehead suggesting that he had accepted her as his

wife. But, because of the resistance from the family members of the respondent

Page 3 of 4
Crl.Rev.P.366/2007
she could not continue in the house of her in-laws for more than 4 days. She

was driven out of the house of the respondent.

9) In the considered view of this court, the judgment passed by the learned
trial court, on consideration of the evidence on record, appears to be
inconformity with the required standard of proof of marriage in a proceeding
under Section 125 Cr.PC as the strict proof of marriage is not necessary in such
proceeding. The learned revisional court of Additional Sessions Judge, Kamrup,
Guwahati, after thoroughly discussing the evidence on record, came to a
conclusion that a marriage was not proved as per Hindu rites, as the parties are
governed by Hindu laws. But, in a proceeding under Section 125 Cr.PC, as

stated above, strict proof of marriage is not necessary.

10) After perusal of the judgments of both the courts below, this court is of
the considered view that the judgment and order passed by the learned trial
court of Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Rangia, is based on evidence on
record and does not require any interference. Accordingly, the judgment and
order passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Kamrup, in Criminal

Revision No. 71/2007, is set aside.
11) Therefore, the revision petition is allowed.
12) The revision petition stands disposed of accordingly.

of the evidence recorded by the learned trial court as well as on perusal of the

3) A proceeding, under Section 125 Cr.PC, was initiated by the present
petitioner, Sabita Deka, against the present respondent, Babul Deka, before the
learned Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Rangia, claiming monthly
maintenance allowance from the respondent. According to her, on 30.3.2006,
the respondent married her by executing a registered agreement at Guwahati,
and, after the agreement was executed, he had put vermilion on her forehead

the respondent has not been providing any maintenance allowance to her.

4) The respondent contested the proceeding before the learned trial court by

petitioner is not his wife and is not entitled to any maintenance allowance.

5) The learned trial court appears to have thoroughly discussed the evidence
on record and found that there is a marriage agreement between both the

respondent took her to his house after putting vermilion on her forehead,
meaning thereby, he had accepted her as his wife from that day itself. |The

the residence of the respondent as husband and wife for 4 days, and thereafter,

she was driven out by the mother, brother and sister of the respondent.

6) In the defence evidence, it is found that the respondent himself, examined
as DW1, admitted the execution of the marriage agreement between him and the
present petitioner. Although he had taken a plea that his signature in the
marriage agreement had been obtained forcibly. He has admitted that though
his signature was taken forcibly without his consent, he had not filed any

agreement, he had accepted the present petitioner as his wife and, this fact is
further substantiated by the fact that he had put vermilion on the forehead of

the present petitioner, meaning thereby, that he had married her.

7) Learned counsel for the petitioner has also referred to the decision of the
Hon’ble Supreme Court in Savitaben Somabhai Bhatiya —-vs- State of Gujarat &

was driven out of the house of the respondent.

9) In the considered view of this court, the judgment passed by the learned
trial court, on consideration of the evidence on record, appears to be
inconformity with the required standard of proof of marriage in a proceeding
under Section 125 Cr.PC as the strict proof of marriage is not necessary in such

the considered view that the judgment and order passed by the learned trial
court of Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Rangia, is based on evidence on
record and does not require any interference. Accordingly, the judgment and
order passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Kamrup, in Criminal

Revision No. 71/2007, is set aside.
11) Therefore, the revision petition is allowed.

JUDGMENT AND ORDER
(ORAL)

Heard Mr. A Dhar, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner. Also heard
Mr. B Sarma, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent.
2. The issue in this revision application involves no intricacies so far the question of law
involved. The respondent as the plaintiff preferred Money Suit No. 115/2013 against the
present petitioner/defendant. Both the petitioner and the respondent are companies having
Its registration under the Companies Act, 1956. The address of the _ present
petitioner/defendant as apparent from the copy of the plaint annexed to this petition Is
shown as having its registered office at Chiring Chapori, Dibrugarh. The present
defendant/ petitioner had obtained a work order from M/S Brahmaputra Cracker and Polymer

Ltd.(BCPL) having its project at Lepetkata in the district of Dibrugarh. The present

CRP 130 OF 2014
Page No.2

plaintiff/respondent entered into a sub-contract with the defendant/ petitioner as against the
work order obtained by the petitioner from M/S BCPL. Dispute between the parties to the
Suit arose and as a result the plaintiff/respondent was constraint to file the Money Suit
No.115/2013 in the court of learned Civil J udge No.2, Kamrup(M), Guwahati. Summons was
served. It is pertinent to mention here that the plaintiff/respondent while filing the suit
impleaded the Principal of the present defendant/petitioner i.e. M/S BCPL as the proforma
defendant No.2. On receipt of summons, the defendant/petitioner preferred an application
bearing No.2425/2013 under Section 20 read with Section 151 with a prayer for returning
the plaint for filing it in the proper court having territorial jurisdiction to try the dispute
between the parties. However, the present respondent did not file any written objection. The
learned court of Civil Judge No.2, Kamrup(M), Guwahati vide order dated 05.03.2014
dismissed the said application No.2425/2013 on the ground that the accrual of cause of
action for filing a suit involves mixed question of law and facts which is required to be
determined on the basis of the evidence. Order dated 05.03.2014 is put under challenge in
this revision application.

3. Mr. Dhar, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that in order to decide an
application raising objection of territorial jurisdiction of a court ought to be decided when the
same Is raised at the very first instance. The basis for deciding such objection are the
averment made in the plaint and not beyond that. In support of the said submission, Mr.
Dhar relies West Bengal State Electriaty Board & Ors Vs. Shanti Conductors Pvt. Ltd!
reported in 2007 (3) GLT 101 and Gooadricke Group Ltd & Anr Vs. Mahmud’ Hasan Sultan &
Anr. Reported in 2011 (4) GLT 170. Placing reliance on the ratio of the said decisions, Mr.
Dhar submits that the issue before the court below ought to have been decided on the
averments made in the plaint. As held in the said decisions, the learned court below was
wrong in rejecting the application inasmuch as the plaint is devoid of any averments being

made about the accrual of cause of action under the territorial jurisdiction of the court

CRP 130 OF 2014
Page No.0

below. As held by the court below, the question of territorial jurisdiction is not a mixed
question of law and facts rather it is an issue to be answered on the pleadings made by the
plaintiff. As such, the court below has failed to apply its jurisdiction and wrongly passed the
impugned order which Is liable to be set aside.

4. Mr. Sharma submits that an affidavit-in-opposition had already been filed by the
respondents to bring to the notice of this court that the defendant/ petitioner had demanded
for payment of outstanding dues to the plaintiff/respondent addressing a letter dated
01.01.2013, at its address at Guwahati. In addition to the said letter, another document is
filed showing the registered office of M/S BCPL to be at Guwahati. Mr. Sarma submits that
the cause of action for the suit accrued at Guwahati following the demand so made as
aforesaid. Mr. Sarma submits that there is no point in allowing the prayer of the petitioner
Inasmuch as the cause of action for filing the suit for the plaintiff/respondent arose at
Guwahati. Submitting so, Mr. Sharma sought for the rejection of the petition without any
Interference by this Court.

5. Considered the submission of both the learned counsels. |n 2007/3) GLT 101, (Supra)
this Court held that the question of jurisdiction has to be determined primarily on the
averment made in the plaint. Similarly, in 2077 (4) GLT (supra) this Court held that the
question of territorial jurisdiction if raised in a court, the same is to be decided from the
contents of the plaint. On the perusal of the plaint by this court in Money Suit No.115/2013,
it is very much apparent that the defendant No.1 company has its registered office at
Dibrugarh. The subject matter of the work Is also situated in the district of Dibrugarh. Except
mentioning the demand notice to the plaintiff/respondent at Guwahati, there is no other
averment with regard to accrual of the cause of action for filing the suit at Guwahati under
the territorial jurisdiction of the learned court below. Considering the same, the learned court
below ought to have decided the issue raised by the defendant/petitioner by going though

the plaint only, instead the learned court below restricted itself and came to a wrong

CRP 130 OF 2014
Page No.4

conclusion that the issue involved in the said application needed evidence to decide Section
21 of the CPC is far more specific inasmuch as the objection with respect to place of suing
must be taken in the court as first instance, at the earliest possible opportunity and for all
cases where issues are settled or before such settlement. As the objection with respect to
place of suing can be settled before settlement of issues, so Section 21 of CPC empowers the
court with a definite understanding that such objection is to be decided on the averments
made in the plaint, inasmuch as issues cannot be settled until and unless written statement
is filed. Considering the same, the order dated 05.03.2014 passed in Misc(J) Case
No.539/2013 arising out of Money Suit No.115/2013 passed by the learned Civil J udge No.2,
Kamrup, Guwahati is set aside directing the learned court below to rehear the petition No.
2425/2013 and dispose of the same as per the observations made hereinabove.

6. This revision petition is accordingly allowed and disposed of.

7. Interim order passed earlier is set aside. Parties to the present petition shall appear
before the learned Court below on 25.10.2017 and on submission of a copy of this order, the
learned court below shall accordingly dispose of the said application, confining to the
averments made in the plaint.

2) By filing this application under Article 227 of the Constitution of India,
the petitioners, who are the defendants in TS No. 31/2015, has challenged the
order dated 21.04.2016, passed by the learned Civil J udge, Tinsukia, in Misc. ( The
defendants did not inform the Court about his death by filing petition under
Order XXII Rule 10-A CPC. Out of the said 7 substituted LRs, 3 sons
only contested the suit and accepted the written statement filed by their father
on 06.11.1990. The nature of reliefs sought for has been stated herein before. 21/2007, in view of the said provisions of Order XXII| Rule 4(2) CPC, they could
not have been permitted to take any stand not appropriate to their legal
character. 10) It is also submitted that all LRs of the original tenant would inherit
joint tenancy, and as the respondents No.1 and 2 had impleaded 7 LRs on
record, the non- joinder of the petitioners in the suit cannot be said to be fatal

because the estate of the deceased father of the respondents No.1 and 2 was

CRP 178/2016 Page 4 of 14
substantially represented by 7 of his LRs and, as such, the respondents No.1 and
2 as well as any other LRs who may be inadvertently left out were also bound by
the decree. 12) It is submitted that it was a question of fact as to whether the interest
of the respondents No.1 and 2 were really represented by others, which must be
decided by framing issues and by leading evidence. In support of his
submissions, the learned counsel for the respondents No.1 and 2 has also relied

on the case of Surayya Begum (supra). 13) It is further submitted that the petitioners have approached this court
under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, where the jurisdiction of this court
IS very limited to see only whether any jurisdictional error was committed by the
learned trial court and to keep it within its legal bounds. Whether the resoondents are bound by the decree passed in TS No. 21/2007 (formerly TS 73/1989) and, whether the order dated
08.09.2015 passed by the learned trial court is vitiated by jurisdictional
error for not rejecting the plaint of TS No. It provides that “Where persons
litigate bona fide in respect of a public noht or of a private noht
Claimed in common for themselves and others, all persons interested
in such right shall, for the purooses of this section, be deemed to
Claim under the person so litigating.” Therefore, when 7 legal heirs of
original defendant were made parties in TS No. Similarly the real owner Is entitled to the benefits
under a decree obtained by his benamidar against a stranger
and at the same time is also bound by the decision. It is for this reason that we find Explanation
VI in the following words in Section 11 of the Code of Civil
Procedure:
‘Explanation Vi. — v. Hence, non- impleading of the respondents No.1 and 2 in TS No. 31/2015 does not disclose that which of the LRs
of the father of the respondents No.1 and 2 were doing business from
the suit premises. It is certainly not projected that the respondents
No.1 and 2 are receiving any share from the profit or loss arising from
the said business. Therefore, there has been a
definite change of the use of the shop. In course of hearing another interesting facet has cropped up. If the
respondents No.1 and 2 has any grievance, it can be agitated without
impleading the petitioners herein, if so advised, (ii) The decree passed
in TS No. 21/2007 (formerly TS 73/1989), which has been upheld by
the Hon'ble Supreme Court binds not only the respondents No.1 and
2, but also any other LRs of the original defendant Late Abdul Hamid
Ansari, if at all they have been left out. 17) The Points of determination are answered as follows:
i. AS regards the first point of determination, as to What are the
materials on which the learned trial Court Is to rely while deciding an
qopolication under Order Vil Rule 11 CPC?, Guru Raj Reddy (supra), for which the said
issue need not be answered again. The relevant paragraph 6 and 7 of
the said case are quoted below:
li. 21/2007, but anyone who has inherited
the estate of Late Abdul Hamid Ansari are bound by the said finding as well as
the decree. Amongst other reasons as stated herein before, the impugned order appears to
be contrary to the Constitution Bench judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of
India in the case of W.K. Mohd. 21/2007 to grant time till 31.01.2016 to vacate the suit premises, the petitioners

have the liberty to move the learned Executing Court to do the needful.","THE GAUHATI HIGH COURT

Heard Mr. S. Banik, the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as
Mr. P.K. Roy, the learned counsel for the respondents. The names of
Respondents No. 3 to 9 were struck of by virtue of order dated 25.07.2016.

CRP 178/2016 Page 1 of 14
2) By filing this application under Article 227 of the Constitution of India,
the petitioners, who are the defendants in TS No. 31/2015, has challenged the
order dated 21.04.2016, passed by the learned Civil J udge, Tinsukia, in Misc. (J)
Case No. 75/2015 arising in TS No. 31/2015, thereby dismissing the petition filed
under Order VII Rule 11 read with section 151 CPC for rejection of plaint.

3) The petitioners herein are the defendants in TS No.30/2015, which
was filed by the respondents herein. The said suit was for declaration that the
plaintiffs are legal heirs of Late Abdul Hamid Ansari along with the proforma
defendants in respect of his estate including the suit premises and for declaration
of their rights along with the proforma defendants in respect of the suit
premises, for declaration that the judgment and decree dated 05.03.2007 passed
by the learned Court of Munsiff at Tinsukia in TS No. 21/1994 [75 73/1989 (Old)
IS Non- operative and not maintainable against the plaintiffs for non- joinder of

them as necessary parties and not executable as well as for perpetual injunction.

4) The suit premises is a shop house. The petitioners herein had filed TS
No. 73/1989 (renumbered as TS 21/1994) for eviction of Abdul Hamid Ansari
from the said shop and for recovery of arrear rent. During the pendency of the
Suit, the said defendant i.e. Abdul Hamid Ansari died on 10.10.2013. The
defendants did not inform the Court about his death by filing petition under
Order XXII Rule 10-A CPC. On an application filed by the petitioners, the
deceased defendant was substituted by his 7 legal representatives (LRs. For
short), viz., 4 sons and 3 daughters. Out of the said 7 substituted LRs, 3 sons
only contested the suit and accepted the written statement filed by their father
on 06.11.1990. However, the suit proceeded ex parte against the remaining 4
LRs as they did not contest the suit. TS 21/2007 was allowed by judgment and
decree dated 05.03.2007 passed by the learned Court of Munsiff at Tinsukia. The
substituted LRs filed TA No. 3/2007, which was dismissed by the learned Court of
Civil Judge, Tinsukia by judgment and decree dated 29.09.2007. Both the said

concurrent judgments and decrees were assailed by the substituted defendants

CRP 178/2016 Page 2 of 14
before this Court by filing CRP No. 25/2008. This Court by judgment and order
dated 31.01.2015, dismissed the said revision and the said order was challenged
before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India by filing special leave petition, which
was numbered as SLP(Civil) No. 17055/2015. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, by
order dated 09.07.2015, dismissed the said SLP by allowing the defendants time
till 31.01.2016 to vacate the suit premises by filing an undertaking in form of an
affidavit.

5) In the meanwhile, after CRP 25/2008 was dismissed by this Court by
order dated 31.01.2015, the respondents No.1 and 2 herein had instituted TS No.
30/2015, which is pending for disposal before the Court of Civil J udge, Tinsukia,
claiming that they were two more daughters of Late Abdul Hamid Ansari and
although they had right over the tenanted premises as heirs of their father, they
were left out from being impleaded and, as such, the TS No. 21/2007 was bad
for non- joinder of necessary parties and, as such, the decree was not

executable. The nature of reliefs sought for has been stated herein before.

6) The petitioners filed an application under Order VI! Rule 11 read with
Section 151 CPC for rejection of the plaint, inter-alia, by alleging that the said
Suit was filed for obstructing the execution of the decree passed in TS 21/2007,
which had attained finality. The said petition was registered as Misc. (J ) Case No.
75/2015. The respondents No.1 and 2 filed their written objection. The learned
Civil J udge, Tinsukia, by order dated 21.04.2016 rejected the said Misc. (J) Case
No. 75/2015, which is the subject of challenge in this revision.

7) The learned counsel for the petitioners submit that for the purpose of
considering the petition for rejection of the plaint under Order VII Rule 11 CPC,
the trial court is only required to find out from the statements in the plaint as to
whether the suit was barred by any law and whether it disclosed any cause of

action. In support of his submissions, the learned counsel for the petitioners

CRP 178/2016 Page 3 of 14
relied on the case of PR Vv. Guru Raj Reddy Vs. P. Neeradha Ready, (2015) 8 SCC
331.

8) It is submitted that the petitioners do not dispute whether the
respondents No.1 and 2 were the daughters or not. The question was that all the
legal representatives/heirs of Late Abdul Hamid Ansari had inherited the tenancy
jointly, and such right of inheritance did not create tenancy in the nature of
severable tenancy, common tenancy or a co-tenancy. In support of his
Submissions, the learned counsel for the petitioners has relied on the case of
H.C. Pandey Vs. GC Paul, (1989) 3 SCC 77.

9) By referring to the provisions of Order XXII Rule 4(2) CPC, the learned
counsel for the petitioners submit that the substituted LRs, i.e. defendants No. 1,
3 and 4 had relied on the written statement filed by their father on 06.11.1990
and even if the respondents No.1 and 2 was impleaed in the said TS No.
21/2007, in view of the said provisions of Order XXII| Rule 4(2) CPC, they could
not have been permitted to take any stand not appropriate to their legal
character. Hence, they would still be a joint tenant together with all other LRs of
the original defendant. In this context, it is further submitted that the categorical
findings of both the courts below was that the defendants were defaulters and it
was not the case of the defendants that at any point of time they had paid any
monthly rent to the petitioners and, as such, the issue of the defendants being a
defaulter included their father, as well as all the joint tenants, being the LRs of
the original defendant. Hence, notwithstanding that the petitioners were not
made defendants in the suit, but even if they were impleaded, they could not

have improved the said fact.

10) It is also submitted that all LRs of the original tenant would inherit
joint tenancy, and as the respondents No.1 and 2 had impleaded 7 LRs on
record, the non- joinder of the petitioners in the suit cannot be said to be fatal

because the estate of the deceased father of the respondents No.1 and 2 was

CRP 178/2016 Page 4 of 14
substantially represented by 7 of his LRs and, as such, the respondents No.1 and
2 as well as any other LRs who may be inadvertently left out were also bound by
the decree. In support of his submissions, the learned counsel for the petitioners
has relied on the case of (1) Mohd Hussain (Dead) by LRs & others Vs.
Occhavlal & Ors., (2008) 3 SCC 233, (li) Surayya Begum (Mst) Vs. Moha. Usrnan
& Others, (1991) 3 SCC 114.

11) Per contra, opposing the present application, the learned counsel for
the respondents No.1 and 2 has read over the petition of Misc. (J) Case No.
75/2015 arising out of TS 30/2015 under Order VII Rule 11 CPC to press home
the point that there was no averment that the plaint was barred by any law or
that there was no cause of action for the suit. Therefore, it is submitted that the
impugned order was rightly passed. It is further submitted that although there
was a total absence of any statement that the plaint/ suit was barred by any law,
yet, the learned trial court had evaluated each and every statement made in the

plaint and arrived at a conclusion that there was no ground to reject the plaint.

12) It is submitted that it was a question of fact as to whether the interest
of the respondents No.1 and 2 were really represented by others, which must be
decided by framing issues and by leading evidence. In support of his
submissions, the learned counsel for the respondents No.1 and 2 has also relied

on the case of Surayya Begum (supra).

13) It is further submitted that the petitioners have approached this court
under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, where the jurisdiction of this court
IS very limited to see only whether any jurisdictional error was committed by the
learned trial court and to keep it within its legal bounds. It is sulbmitted that even
if the decision by the learned trial court was erroneous, yet, this court under
Article 227 of the Constitution of India would not have power to substitute its

view over the discretion exercised by the learned trial court.

CRP 178/2016 Page 5 of 14
14) At the outset, this court had put a pointed question to the learned
counsel for the respondents No.1 and 2 as to how many legal heirs did the father
of the respondents No.1 and 2 had left at the time of his death. On consulting
their records, the learned Counsels for the respondents No.1 and 2 had
Submitted that at the time of his death, the father of the petitioners had left
behind 7 sons and 5 daughters, out of which only 5 sons and 3 daughters were
impleaded. Therefore, going by the nature of suit filed, this Court finds that the
respondents No.1 and 2 had themselves only impleaded 7 siblings as defendants
No. 3 to 9 in TS No. 31/2015. Therefore, from the said submission, it appears to
this court that there is still scope for 3 remaining siblings to also come forward to
challenge the decree, passed in TS No. 21/2007 and also to challenge the
decree, if any, passed in TS No. 31/2015.

15) Upon hearing the learned counsels for both sides, the following point
of determination arises in the present case: 
|. What are the materials on which the learned trial Court Is to rely while
deciding an application under Order Vil Rule 11 CPC?

ll. Whether the resoondents are bound by the decree passed in TS No.
21/2007 (formerly TS 73/1989) and, whether the order dated
08.09.2015 passed by the learned trial court is vitiated by jurisdictional
error for not rejecting the plaint of TS No. 30/2015?

16) The aforesaid points of determination are taken up together. As per

the respondents No.1 and 2, the petitioners, who are the married daughters of

Late Abdul Hamid Ansari, the original tenant and defendant in TS No. 21/2007

were a necessary party, required to be impleaded as one of the substituted LRs
of the said original defendant in TS No. 21/2007.

|. First of all, if the plea of the respondents No.1 and 2 that they also

inherited the estate left behind by their father is at all acceptable, then

the said inheritance must be under the principles of Mohammedan

Law. The petitioners, being two out of 5 sisters would get their share

as a reversionary and, as such, they do not inherit a separate share

CRP 178/2016 Page 6 of 14
but they acquire their shares jointly. Hence, under the principles of
Mohammedan Law, if tenancy is inherited, all the legal heirs take the
estate jointly and the tenancy partakes the character of joint tenancy
and the respondents No.1 and 2 do not become tenants in common or
acquire any right of co-tenancy.

li. As the respondents No.1 and 2 take the character of joint tenants, as
such, the estate left behind by the father of the respondents No.1 and
2 must be deemed to be sufficiently represented by seven out of nine
legal heirs (for time being on record). Notwithstanding that the
learned counsel for the respondents No.1 and 2 had submitted that
the original defendant/ tenant in TS No. 21/2007 had 12 children, but
at this stage, in the absence of any material on record, this court does
not take cognizance of remaining 3 legal heirs who are left out by the
respondents No.1 and 2 in TS No. 31/2005.

lil. At this stage, it would be relevant to refer to the provisions of
Explanation-VI of Section 11 CPC. It provides that “Where persons
litigate bona fide in respect of a public noht or of a private noht
Claimed in common for themselves and others, all persons interested
in such right shall, for the purooses of this section, be deemed to
Claim under the person so litigating.” Therefore, when 7 legal heirs of
original defendant were made parties in TS No. 21/2007, it can be
deemed that the right so agitated/ defended comes within the scope
of Explanation-VI of Section 11 CPC.

iv. AS an example, assuming that the respondents No.1 and 2 had jointly
inherited the tenancy, then they are also deemed to be aware that her
father, when alive, was litigating with his landlord. Yet, at the relevant
time, the said respondents did not come forward to get themselves
impleaded. It is not their projected case in the plaint of TS No.
31/2015 that there was any collusion between the petitioners- landlord
and the 7 substituted LRs of sole defendant in TS No. 21/2007.

Therefore, under the provisions of Explanation-VI of Section 11 CPC,

all the LRs arrayed as substituted defendants in TS No. 21/2007 are
deemed to be litigating for the respondents No.1 and 2. For this
proposition, this Court relies on the case of Surayya Begum Vs. Moha!
Usman, (1991) 3 SCC 114 (para-9), where the appeal arising out of
the claim of daughters of tenant was dismissed. The said paragraph is
quoted below:“9, The prinaple of reoresentation of the interest of a person,
not imoleaded by name in a judical proceeding, through a
named party Is not unknown. A karta of a Joint Hindu Family
has always been recognised as a reoresentative of the other
members of the Joint Hindu family, and so has been a trustee.
In cases where the provisions of Order /, Rule & of the Civil
Procedure Code are attracted a named party in a sult
reoresents the other persons interested in the litigation, and
likewise a receiver apoointed in one case reoresents the
interest of the litigating parties in another case against a
stranger. Similarly the real owner Is entitled to the benefits
under a decree obtained by his benamidar against a stranger
and at the same time is also bound by the decision. Examples
can be multiplied. It is for this reason that we find Explanation
VI in the following words in Section 11 of the Code of Civil
Procedure:
‘Explanation Vi. — Where persons litigate bona fide in
resoect of a public nght or of a private night Claimed in
common for themselves and others, all persons
interested in such right shall, for the purposes of this
section, be deemed to Cdaim under the persons so
litigating. ”
This, of course, Is subject to the essential conaition that the
interest of a person concerned has really been reoresented by the

others; in other words, his interest has been looked after in a bona

CRP 178/2016 Page 8 of 14
fide manner. If there be any Clash of interests between the person
concerned and his assumed reoresentative or if the latter due to
collusion or for any other reason, mala fide neglects to defend the
case, he cannot be considered to be a reoresentative. The Issue
when it becomes relevant, has, therefore, to be answered with
reference to the facts and arcumstances of the individual case.
There may be instances in which the position is absolutely clear
beyond any reasonable doubt one way or the other and the
guestion can be settled without any difficulty; but in other cases
the issue may have to be deaded with reference to relevant
evidence to be led by the parties. Surayya Begum's case Is of this

Class While Renu Sharma's appeal belongs to the first category.”

v. Hence, non- impleading of the respondents No.1 and 2 in TS No.
21/2007 cannot be said to be fatal to the executablity of the decree
passed in the said suit.

vi. The plaint of TS No. 31/2015 does not disclose that which of the LRs
of the father of the respondents No.1 and 2 were doing business from
the suit premises. It is certainly not projected that the respondents
No.1 and 2 are receiving any share from the profit or loss arising from
the said business. It is not even pleaded that the respondents No.1
and 2 are paying any rent to the petitioners- landlord. Moreover, as
per the statements made in paragraph 14 of the plaint of TS No.
31/2015, there is a specific statement that the petitioners are residing
In the suit premises, which is admittedly a commercial shop even as
per the schedule described in the plaint. Therefore, there has been a
definite change of the use of the shop. This is a situation which is
covered by Proviso (a) of Section 5(1) of The Assam Urban Areas Rent
Control Act, 1972, being an act covered by Clause (0) of Section 108
of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. But save and except passing a

comment, for the present the said issue has not influenced this Court.

CRP 178/2016 Page 9 of 14
vil. In course of hearing another interesting facet has cropped up. The
learned counsel for the petitioners had sought oral leave to produce
certified copies of documents filed along with the plaint of TS No.
31/2015 to show collusion between the defendants therein by showing
that the photocopy of certified copies of documents would indicate
that such copies were available with the petitioners several years prior
to the institution of the suit and, as such, the plea that the
respondents No.1 and 2 came to know about the decree only on
20.04.2015 was false. However, as no leave was granted, at present,
this issue has not influenced this court.

vill. As the estate of the father of respondents No.1 and 2 is found to be
represented 7 (seven) legal heirs in TS No. 21/2007, the estate must
be held to be sufficiently represented in the suit and the omission to
array the two respondents No.1 and 2, as the deceased’s legal heirs,
who had never asserted her right over the shop or participated in its
management or in sharing profits and loss, cannot be permitted to
defeat the decree passed in TS No. 21/2007 (formerly TS 73/1989)
after 28 years of litigation as on this day, after such decree has been
upheld by the Hon’ble Supreme Court. In absence of any proof to the
contrary, it must be deemed by necessary implication that the
respondents No.1 and 2 had surrendered their respective rights, if
there be any, in favour of the defendants made parties in TS No.
21/2007.

Ix. The respondents No.1 and 2 were neither a necessary nor a proper
party in TS No. 21/2004 and, as such, the said suit cannot be said to
be bad for their non-joinder as a co-defendants in the suit, as the
estate of their father was sufficiently represented by the defendants
already impleaded as LRs in the suit.

x. It would be relevant to refer to the Constitution Bench of the Hon’ble
Supreme Court of India, in the case of N.K. Mohd. Sulaiman Sahib Vs.
N.C. Mohd. Ismail Saheb, AIR 1966 SC 792 (para 14) has held that

CRP 178/2016 Page 10 of 14
“Where however on account of a bona fide error, the plaintiff
seeking relief institutes his suit against a person who Is not
reoresenting the estate of a deceased person against whom the
Plaintiff has a claim either at all or at even partially, in the absence of
fraud or collusion or other ground which taint a decree, a decree
passed against the persons impoleaded as heirs binds the estate, even
though other persons interested in the estate are not brought on the
record. This principle applies to all parties irrespective of their religious
persuasion.” Thus, there being no taint on the decree in TS No.
21/2007, the non-impleading of any remaining LRs of the original
tenant including the respondents No.1 and 2 does not vitiate the
decree passed in TS No. 21/2007 (formerly TS 73/1989), as the
decree has been upheld by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India as
indicated above. The orders of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India
cannot be permitted to be diluted by filing of subsequent suit i.e. TS
No. 31/2017.

xi. The categorical finding by this Court are (i) TS No.21/2007 (formerly
TS 73/1989) was maintainable despite the respondents No.1 and 2 not
being arrayed because the remaining LRs of deceased defendant were
sufficiently representing the estate of the deceased. If the
respondents No.1 and 2 has any grievance, it can be agitated without
impleading the petitioners herein, if so advised, (ii) The decree passed
in TS No. 21/2007 (formerly TS 73/1989), which has been upheld by
the Hon'ble Supreme Court binds not only the respondents No.1 and
2, but also any other LRs of the original defendant Late Abdul Hamid
Ansari, if at all they have been left out. Thus, the second suit i.e. TS
No. 21/2007 (formerly TS 73/1989) is hit by the principles of resjudicata.

xii. Hence, the cumulative result of the discussions above is that the plaint

of TS No. 31/2015 was not maintainable as there was no cause of

CRP 178/2016 Page 11 of 14
action for the suit and the suit was barred by law, for which the plaint
of TS No. 31/2015 was liable to be rejected.

17) The Points of determination are answered as follows:
i. AS regards the first point of determination, as to What are the
materials on which the learned trial Court Is to rely while deciding an
qopolication under Order Vil Rule 11 CPC?, this court is of the opinion
that the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has already settled the said
issue in the case of PV. Guru Raj Reddy (supra), for which the said
issue need not be answered again. The relevant paragraph 6 and 7 of
the said case are quoted below:
li. On the second point of determination, i.e. whether the resoondents
are bound by the decree passed in TS No. 21/2007 (formerly TS
771989) and, whether the order dated 08.09.2015 passed by the
learned trial court Is vitiated by jurisdictional error for not rejecting the
plaint of TS No. 30/2015?7, for the reasons as assigned in paragraph
16 above and as briefly summed up in paragraph 19, 20 and 21
below, this court is of the opinion that the respondents No.1 and 2 are
bound by the decree passed in TS No. 21/2007 (formerly TS 73/1989)
and therefore, the order dated 08.09.2015 passed by the learned trial
court Is vitiated by jurisdictional error for not rejecting the plaint of TS
No. 30/2015.

18) There is one more aspect of the matter. Both the Courts below have
held that the Defendants were a defaulter. This is a concurrent finding of fact.
Thus not only the Defendants in TS No. 21/2007, but anyone who has inherited
the estate of Late Abdul Hamid Ansari are bound by the said finding as well as
the decree. Therefore, even if the respondents No.1 and 2 herein were
impleaded in the suit, the said finding of defaulter cannot be wished away as
admittedly they never tendered any rent to the petitioners- landlord at any point

of time. A defaulter legatee cannot be permitted to file successive suits to scuttle

CRP 178/2016 Page 12 of 14
a lawful decree passed in TS No. 21/2007 (formerly TS 73/1989). The

Subsequent suit is not maintainable on this Court.

19) As a result, the first appellate court is found to have exercised
jurisdiction with material irregularity by incorrectly appreciating the facts and law.
Amongst other reasons as stated herein before, the impugned order appears to
be contrary to the Constitution Bench judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of
India in the case of W.K. Mohd. Sulaiman Sahib (supra) and moreover, the said
learned court has also failed to appreciate the provisions of Explanation- VI of
Section 11 CPC. Thus, the subsequent suit, |.e. TS No. 31/2015 appears to have
been filed in order to frustrate the lawful decree passed in TS No. 21/2007 [TS
No. 73/1989 (Old)], and the non- joinder of the present respondents No.1 and,
namely, Smt. Fatima Begum and Smt. Asgari Begum or any other legal heir of
Late Abdul Hamid Ansari is not fatal to the TS No. 21/2007 as their interest was
sufficiently represented by other 7 legal heirs of their father. Moreover, the lawful
decree passed in TS No. 21/2007 has attained finality, having been upheld by the
highest Court of the land |.e. Supreme Court of India, which must be respected
as the said decree is not found to be tainted in any manner. Hence, the learned
Civil Judge, Tinsukia, is held to have committed jurisdictional error as indicated

above.

20) Therefore, in view of the discussions above, the TS No.21/2007 [TS
No. 73/1989 (Old)] is found to be maintainable and the said suit is not hit by nonjoinder of the present respondents No.1 and, namely, Smt. Fatima Begum and
Smt. Asgari Begum or any other legal heir of Late Abdul Hamid Ansari as the
estate of the deceased is found to be sufficiently represented in the said suit and
such decree which has attained finality after about 26 years of litigation which
started in the year 1989 cannot be allowed to be frustrated. The TS No.31/2015
is therefore, barred by the principles of res-judicata and lack of cause of action.
The decree passed in TS No. 21/2007 [TS No. 73/1989 (Old)] is not liable to be

CRP 178/2016 Page 13 of 14
interfered with, because it has been upheld by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of
India by order dated 30.01.2015, passed in SLP (Civil) No. 17055/2015.

21) Therefore, for the reasons as indicated above, the order dated
21.04.2016, passed by the learned Civil Judge, Tinsukia, in Misc. (J) Case No.
75/2015 arising in TS No. 31/2015 is not sustainable and the same is set aside,
being vitiated by jurisdictional error. Consequently, Misc. (J) Case No. 75/2015
arising in TS No. 31/2015 stands allowed and the plaint of TS No. 31/2015

stands rejected.

22) As the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India by order dated 30.01.2015,
passed in SLP (Civil) No. 17055/2015, had directed the defendants in TS No.
21/2007 to grant time till 31.01.2016 to vacate the suit premises, the petitioners

have the liberty to move the learned Executing Court to do the needful.

23) This application stands allowed. The parties are left to bear their own
cost.

iv. Adecree for costs of the suit;

v. Any other relief/reliefs which the plaintiff is entitled under the law and

impleading the Respondents No.11 to 14 and one Smrt. 509, K.P. Patta No.20 of a particular
Village and Mouza (forming a part of land described in Schedule-A of the plaint). Owing to the said subsequent development, the prayer for amendment of the

plaint was made. 6) In the meantime, the newly impleaded defendants No.12 to 15 (i.e.
respondents No. 11 to 14 herein) filed their written statement on 26.08.2016. They also filed their written objection against the amendment petition on
08.12.2016. It
was held that that it was a basic rule of every civil litigation that the rights of the
parties must be determined on the basis of the date of filing of the suit. In Support of
his argument, the learned counsel for the petitioner has relied on the case of (i)
Sampath Kumar Vs. 9) Per contra, the learned counsel for the respondent No.3 has argued in

support of the impugned order. Hence,
the suit would be bad for joinder of separate cause of action. If such amendment
was allowed, it would change the nature and character of the suit and would
enlarge the scope of the suit. In course of his argument, the learned counsel for
the respondent No.3 has referred to the stand taken by the parties in the plaint
and written statements, as well as in the petition for amendment and objection
filed thereto. 11 to 14
had no involvement in the suit and, as such, they were strangers to the suit. \f this finding is put to
test on the basis of a hypothetical subsequent event, say, in a suit for
confirmation of possession, the plaintiff is dispossessed from the suit land, then
whether he will be precluded from amending his plaint to seek recovery of
possession merely because the event of dispossession was a subsequent event
which is not relatable to the date of filing of the plaint or that it would change
the nature and character of the suit. 13) The other finding by the learned trial court is that the petitioner was
not a party to the “Deed of Mutual Compromise & Settlement dated 15.12.2014”. One of the questions which is
required to be answered is whether in the event the suit as it stands in the
present form is decreed, whether the same would affect the land which is
covered by the said deed dated 15.12.2014. Thus, if
prayer (i) happens to be decreed, it would result in revocation of Power of
Attorney being declared illegal and there is no doubt that the purported right of
the petitioner- plaintiff over land covered by the said Deed dated 15.12.2014

would stand revived. 14) Addressing the case of Kanailal Das (supra), cited by the learned
counsel for the Proforma Respondents No.11 to 14, it is seen that the various
principles for allowing amendment of the plaint are stated in paragraph 5
thereof, which is quoted below: 
“5) THE prinaples established by judicial decisions in respect of

amenament of plaint are as follows: 
(1) All amenaments will be generally permissible when they are
necessary for determination of the real controversy in the
sult. CRP 98/2017 Page 7 of 17
(iV) In general, the amendments should not cause prejudice to
the other side which cannot be cornoensated in costs. 15) The learned counsel for the Proforma Respondents No.11 to 14 has
laid stress on sub-para (ii) of para 5. The “Deed of Mutual Compromise & Settlement dated 15.12.2014” Is
executed after the present suit was filed and, a challenge to the said deed is
found to be in aid to preserve the right of the petitioner- plaintiff, in the event
prayer (i) of the plaint is decreed. In this regard, the provisions
of Order | Rule 10(4) CPC are quoted below:‘Order | Rule 10(4) Where defendant added, plaint to be
amended. - 18) This court in the case of Ku/Oir Singh (supra), cited by the learned
counsel for the Proforma Respondents No.11 to 14, has held that no amendment
Should be allowed after the trial has commenced unless the court comes to a
finding that in spite of due diligence, the party could not have raised the matter
before the commencement of trial and it was further held that a party cannot
seek amendment of his pleadings so as to project altogether a different case
then one projected in the suit. Provided that no application for
amendment shall be allowed after the tnal has commenced, unless the
Court comes to the conclusion that in spite of due diligence, the party
could not have raised the matter before the commencement of trial. (17) Needless to say that on the strength of the aforesaid
provision, a party cannot seek amendment of his pleadings so as to
project altogether a different case than the one which was projected
in the suit. and the plaint was then
sought to be amended by filing petition on 09.08.2016. Therefore, there appears
to be no lack of due diligence on part of the petitioner. Moreover, as stated
above, the plaint is required to be amended once a defendant is added. 20) It must be re-stated that the learned trial court had held that “/f the
amendment of the plaint was allowed it would change the nature and character
of the plaint and that at most, the plaintiff may be advised to bring a seoarate

suit to challenge the deed of compromise, subject to provisions of law.” \|n this

CRP 98/2017 Page 10 of 17
regard, the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of (i) Sampath Kumar (supra) and
(ii) Rajesh Kumar Aggarwal (supra), has held that if the party is permitted to file
a fresh suit then why he should not be permitted to amend the plaint. The
relevant paragraphs are quoted below:(i) Sampath Kumar (supra), para 6 to 12:
“6. [ t Is true that the plaintiff on the averments made in
the application for amendment proposes to introduce a cause of
action which has arisen to the plaintiff during the pendency of
the suit, According to the defendant the averments made in the
qgoolication for amendment are factually incorrect and the
defendant was not in possession of the property since before
the institution of the suit itself. /n our opinion, the basic structure of the sult is not
altered by the proposed amendment. What is sought to be
changed is the nature of relief sought for by the plaintiff. n the facts and circumstances of the present case,
allowing the amendment would curtail multioliaty of legal
proceedings. Such
amendments as are directed towards putting-forth and seeking
determination of the real questions in controversy between the
parties shall be permitted to be made. The fact remains that
a mere delay cannot be a ground for refusing a prayer for
amenament. An amendment once incorporated relates back to the
date of the suit. n the present case the amendment is being sought
for almost 11 years after the date of the institution of the suit. On the averments made in the application, the sarne
ought to have been allowed. If the facts alleged by plaintiff are
not correct it Is open for the defendant to take such plea in the

written statement and if the plaintiff fails in substantiating the

CRP 98/2017 Page 13 of 17
(Mi)

CRP 98/2017

factual averments and/or the defendant succeeds in
substantiating the plea which he would obviously be permitted to
raise in his pleading by way of consequential amendment then
the suit shall be lable to be dismissed. This rule declares that the Court may, at any stage of the
proceedings, allow either party to alter or amend his
pleadings in such a manner and on such terms as may be
Just. The second part Is

Imperative (shall) and eryoins the Court to allow all

amenaments which are necessary for the purpose of

determining the real question in controversy between the

parties. We fail to understand if it Is
permissible for the appellants to file an indeoendent suit,
why the same relief which could be prayed for in the new
suit cannot be permitted to be incorporated in the pending
sult. If it Is, the
amenament will be allowed; if it is not, the amendment will
be refused. Likewise, it should not record a finding on
the merits of the amendment and the merits of the
amendment sought to be incorporated by way of
amendment are not to be adjudged at the stage of allowing
the prayer for amendment. Hence, this court has no hesitation in setting
aside the order dated 23.05.2016 passed by the Court of the learned Civil J udge
No.2, Kamrup (Metropolitan), Guwahati in Misc. 24) Consequently, the application under Order VI Rule 17 CPC for

Heard Mr. P.C. Dey, the learned Counsel for the petitioners, Mr.

although notices have been duly served on them.

2) In challenge in this application under Article 227 of the Constitution of
India is the order dated 23.05.2016 passed by the Court of the learned Civil
Judge No.2, Kamrup (Metropolitan), Guwahati in Misc. (J) Case No. 554/2016,

CRP 98/2017 Page 1 of 17
thereby rejecting the application filed by the petitioner - plaintiff under Order VI
Rule 17 CPC.

3) The petitioner - plaintiff had originally instituted the said suit against
the respondents No. 10 herein, out of which the respondents No.1 to 8 were
arrayed as Defendants No.1 to 8 and the respondents No. 9 and 10 herein were
arrayed as Proforma Defendants. The following reliefs were prayed in the plaint:
l. A decree for declaring that the revocation of Power-of-Attorney No.
1532/2002 dated 02.04.2002 vide Revocation of Power-of-Attorney
Deed No. 1850/2002 dated 18.04.2002 by the Defendant No. 1 and 3
illegal, null and void;

li. A decree for recovery of Rs.56,91,000/- (Rupees fifty-six lakhs and
ninety one thousand) only from the defendants either jointly or
severally being the advance money taken from the plaintiff along with
the interest @ 18% per annum;

lil. A decree for recovery of Rs.25,00,000/- (Rupees twenty five lakhs)
only from defendants as compensation for the loss and for causing
mental agony an harassment to the plaintiff alongwith the interest @
18 per annum;

iv. Adecree for costs of the suit;

v. Any other relief/reliefs which the plaintiff is entitled under the law and

equity.

4) During the pendency of the suit, the petitioner by filing petition No.
1046/2015 dated 11.03.2015 under Order | Rule 10(2) CPC, prayed for
impleading the Respondents No.11 to 14 and one Smrt. Birathi Nath (dead)
herein as Proforma Defendants, which was allowed by the learned trial court by
order dated 23.05.2016 and the said 5 (five) persons were arrayed as Proforma
Defendants No.11 to 15. The court is surprised to find that despite mention in
the cause title of the said petition that Late Birathi Nath was dead, yet the

CRP 98/2017 Page 2 of 17
learned trial court had permitted a dead person to be impleaded as a party in the

suit.

5) On 09.08.2016, the petitioner filed an application under Order VI Rule
17 CPC for amendment of the plaint, which was numbered as petition No. 3840
and registered as Misc. (J) Case No. 554/16. It was projected in the said petition
that during the pendency of the suit, it had come to the knowledge of the
petitioner that the Proforma Defendant No.10 had entered into a “Deed of Mutual
Compromise & Settlement” dated 15.12.2014 with Smt. Birathi Nath (since
deceased) and the respondents No.11 to 14 herein to sell a plot of land
measuring 5B-2K-9L covered by Dag No. 509, K.P. Patta No.20 of a particular
Village and Mouza (forming a part of land described in Schedule-A of the plaint).
Owing to the said subsequent development, the prayer for amendment of the

plaint was made.

6) In the meantime, the newly impleaded defendants No.12 to 15 (i.e.
respondents No. 11 to 14 herein) filed their written statement on 26.08.2016.
They also filed their written objection against the amendment petition on
08.12.2016.

7) The learned trial court, upon hearing the counsels for the appearing
parties, arrived at a finding that the petitioner- plaintiff was not a party to the
said agreement dated 15.12.2014 and that the amendment sought for was not
germane to the strife between the parties and that by the proposed amendment,
the petitioner herein was seeking to bring in the matter involving the Proforma
Defendants No.11 to 15 (i.e. deceased proforma defendant No.11 and Proforma
Respondents No.11 to 14 herein), which is beyond the scope of adjudication in a
suit for revocation for power of attorney executed by defendant No.1 and 2. It
was held that that it was a basic rule of every civil litigation that the rights of the
parties must be determined on the basis of the date of filing of the suit. It was

also held that if the amendment of the plaint was allowed it would change the

CRP 98/2017 Page 3 of 17
nature and character of the plaint and that at most, the plaintiff may be advised
to bring a separate suit to challenge the deed of compromise, subject to

provisions of law.

8) The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that while one of the
challenge in the plaint filed by the petitioner was that revocation of the Power of
Attorney No. 1532/2002 dated 02.04.2002 vide Revocation of Power of Attorney
Deed No. 1850/2002 by the defendant No.1 was illegal and void, if the mutual
settlement vide deed dated 15.12.2014 is not challenged and allowed to stand, in
the event, the said prayer in the plaint is decided in his favour, that decree would
stand frustrated. He has submitted that although Sri Pradip Prakash Das
(Proforma Defendant No.10) had signed the said agreement with the Proforma
Defendants No. 11 to 15, under clause 1 thereof, he was to receive the
consideration for the land mentioned thereunder and would distribute it amongst
the Defendants No.1 to 8 and Proforma Defendants No.9 and 10 and, as such,
the same was to frustrate the suit, where one of the reliefs was that the
revocation of the Power of Attorney by the defendants No.1 and 2 was illegal. It
is submitted that in the event the prayer (i) of the plaint was decreed, then the
right flowing in respect of the land covered by “Deed of Mutual Compromise &
Settlement dated 15.12.2014” would revert back to him. It is submitted that if
the petitioner is entitled to file a separate suit, then in order to shorten litigation
and to avoid multiplicity of litigation, it would be in the interest of justice to allow
the amendment of the plaint. It is submitted that the petition for amendment
was filed after issues were framed and before the plaintiff had submitted the
Evidence- On- Affidavit of the Plaintiff's Witnesses (PWs for short). In Support of
his argument, the learned counsel for the petitioner has relied on the case of (i)
Sampath Kumar Vs. Ayyakannu & Anr., (2002) 7 SCC 559, and (ii) Rajesh Kumar
Aggarwal & Ors. Vs. K.K. Modal, (2006) 4 SCC 385.

9) Per contra, the learned counsel for the respondent No.3 has argued in

support of the impugned order. It is submitted the prayer for challenging the

CRP 98/2017 Page 4 of 17
revocation of Power of Attorney was merely an incidental or alternative prayer
and the primary prayer of the petitioner- plaintiff was for recovery of a sum of
Rs.56,91,000/- from the defendants and a further sum of Rs.25,00,000/- as
compensation with 18% interest thereon. It is also submitted that in a suit
containing prayers as stated herein before, there is no way that a distinct cause
of action arising subsequently on 15.12.2014, when the “Deed of Mutual
Compromise & Settlement dated 15.12.2014” was entered, can be joined. Hence,
the suit would be bad for joinder of separate cause of action. If such amendment
was allowed, it would change the nature and character of the suit and would
enlarge the scope of the suit. In course of his argument, the learned counsel for
the respondent No.3 has referred to the stand taken by the parties in the plaint
and written statements, as well as in the petition for amendment and objection
filed thereto.

10) Also opposing the present application, the learned counsel for the
Respondents No.11 to 14 has also submitted that the respondents No. 11 to 14
had no involvement in the suit and, as such, they were strangers to the suit. It is
submitted that there were two distinct cause of action, which was sought to be
joined by the proposed amendment. By referring to the pleadings of the parties,
it is submitted that if the proposed amendment is allowed, it would change the
basic nature and character of the plaint. It was also submitted that the parties
between whom the “Deed of Mutual Compromise & Settlement dated
15.12.2014” was executed, were litigating before this Court in W.P.(C) No.
3909/2009 and after years of litigation, the parties viz., the Proforma Respondent
No.10 and Proforma Respondents No. 11 to 14 including Late Birathi Nath, with a
view to end the litigation had entered into a compromise and the proceedings of
W.P.(C) No. 3909/2009 had ended on compromise and, as such, it was
preposterous to allow the proposed amendment, which would question the
compromise done in the said writ petition. The learned counsel for the Proforma
Respondents No.11 to 14 had made an attempt to submit (i) about the past

litigation history, (li) various agreements relating to the suit land, and (lili)

CRP 98/2017 Page 5 of 17
whether the suit and reliefs claimed were barred by limitation, but as the subject
matter of this present application was limited to the challenge to the impugned
order by which amendment was refused, this court was disinclined to hear the
learned counsel for the Proforma Respondents No. 11 to 14 on those points. In
support of his argument, the learned counsel had relied on the case of (i)
Kanailal Das & Anr. Vs. /iban Kanal Das, A!R 1977 Cal 189, (ii) Kulbir Singh Vs.
Pritoal Shdev, 2011 (3) GLT 539.

11) This court has considered the arguments advanced by the learned

counsels for the appearing parties and the cases cited by them.

12) It appears that one of the finding by the learned trial court was that “/t
was a basic rule of every avi litigation that the rights of the parties must be
determined on the basis of the date of filing of the suit.” \f this finding is put to
test on the basis of a hypothetical subsequent event, say, in a suit for
confirmation of possession, the plaintiff is dispossessed from the suit land, then
whether he will be precluded from amending his plaint to seek recovery of
possession merely because the event of dispossession was a subsequent event
which is not relatable to the date of filing of the plaint or that it would change
the nature and character of the suit. The answer would be a emphatic ‘no’.
Therefore, in the case of amendment of plaint or written statement, there cannot
be a straight jacket formula which can be applied and each case must be tested

in the light of its unique facts.

13) The other finding by the learned trial court is that the petitioner was
not a party to the “Deed of Mutual Compromise & Settlement dated 15.12.2014”.
This is very true and no one has disputed this fact. One of the questions which is
required to be answered is whether in the event the suit as it stands in the
present form is decreed, whether the same would affect the land which is
covered by the said deed dated 15.12.2014. To answer this, one must refer to

the various plots of land described in Schedules A to G of the plaint. On a perusal

CRP 98/2017 Page 6 of 17
thereof, the plot of land measuring 5B-2K-9L, which is the subject matter of
Deed dated 15.12.2014, covered by Dag No. 509, K.P. Patta No.20 of a particular
Village and Mouza, finds mention in Schedule-A, Schedule-B, Schedule-E and
Schedule-G of the plaint. However, on a pointed query by this Court, the learned
counsel for the petitioner and Proforma Respondents No.11 to 14 are aa-idem
that the land mentioned in “Deed of Mutual Compromise & Settlement dated
15.12.2014” is covered by Schedule-B. The said version is accepted for the time
being and it is clarified that the same is not the finding by this court. Thus, if
prayer (i) happens to be decreed, it would result in revocation of Power of
Attorney being declared illegal and there is no doubt that the purported right of
the petitioner- plaintiff over land covered by the said Deed dated 15.12.2014

would stand revived.

14) Addressing the case of Kanailal Das (supra), cited by the learned
counsel for the Proforma Respondents No.11 to 14, it is seen that the various
principles for allowing amendment of the plaint are stated in paragraph 5
thereof, which is quoted below: 
“5) THE prinaples established by judicial decisions in respect of

amenament of plaint are as follows: 
(1) All amenaments will be generally permissible when they are
necessary for determination of the real controversy in the
sult.

(ii) All the same, substitution of one cause of action or the
nature of the claim for another in the orginal plaint or
change of the subject-matter of or controversy in the suit Is
not perrssible.

(ili) Introduction by amendment of inconsistent or contradictory
allegations in negation of the admitted position on facts, or
mutually destructive allegations of facts are also
Imopermissible though inconsistent pleas on the admitted

position can be introduced by way of amendment.

CRP 98/2017 Page 7 of 17
(iV) In general, the amendments should not cause prejudice to
the other side which cannot be cornoensated in costs.

(v) § Amendment of a caim or relief which ts barred by limitation
when the amendment Is sought to be made should not be
allowed to defeat a legal right accrued exceot when such
consideration is outweighed by the soecal arcurnstances of

the case.”

15) The learned counsel for the Proforma Respondents No.11 to 14 has
laid stress on sub-para (ii) of para 5. But in the case in hand, the petitioner is not
found to substitute the cause of action or the nature of the claim with another
and there appears to be no change in the subject matter of controversy, because
in the considered opinion of this Court, even if the amendment is permitted, it
would be in the aid of the basic relief under prayer (i) of the plaint as quoted
above. The “Deed of Mutual Compromise & Settlement dated 15.12.2014” Is
executed after the present suit was filed and, a challenge to the said deed is
found to be in aid to preserve the right of the petitioner- plaintiff, in the event
prayer (i) of the plaint is decreed. The Proforma Defendants No. 11 to 14 were
already brought on record by impleading them by order dated 23.05.2016.
Thereafter, the plaint is sought to be amended by petition filed on 09.08.2016.

16) Ideally, under the provisions of Order 1 Rule 10(4) CPC, when a
defendant is added, the plaint is required to be amended, unless court otherwise
directs, and it is provided that amended copies of summons and of the plaint
Shall be served on the newly impleaded defendants. In this regard, the provisions
of Order | Rule 10(4) CPC are quoted below:‘Order | Rule 10(4) Where defendant added, plaint to be
amended. - Where a defendant Is added, the plaint shall, unless the
court otherwise airects, be amended in such manner as may be

necessary, and amended copies of the summons and of the plaint

CRP 98/2017 Page 8 of 17
Shall be served on the new defendant and, if the court thinks fit on

the original defendant. ”

17) Therefore, notwithstanding the provisions of Order VI Rule 17 CPC,
this Court is of the considered opinion that on impleading of defendant in a suit,
the plaintiff has yet another legal opportunity to amend the plaint, which is not

bound by the rigours of the provisions of Order VI Rule 17 CPC.

18) This court in the case of Ku/Oir Singh (supra), cited by the learned
counsel for the Proforma Respondents No.11 to 14, has held that no amendment
Should be allowed after the trial has commenced unless the court comes to a
finding that in spite of due diligence, the party could not have raised the matter
before the commencement of trial and it was further held that a party cannot
seek amendment of his pleadings so as to project altogether a different case
then one projected in the suit. The relevant paragraph 15, 16 and 17 are quoted
below: “(15) The amendment petition was filed after long 16 years of
filing of the sult with the aforesaid statements and prayer. It Is in this
context, learned Trial Court has held that there was lack of due
diligence and that if the amendments are allowed, same would cause
prejudice to the defendants/ respondents. /t has also been observed
that the amendment would change the very basis of the claim of the
petitioner /plaintiff in the suit and consequently would lead to change
in the nature and character of the suit.
(16) While it is true that as per the principles of law laid’ down in
different decisions relating to prayer for amendment during the
pendency of the suit and the stages thereof, a liberal approach Is
required to be adopted: However, at the sarne time, it will have to be
considered in the context of the nature and character of the suit. If
the amendments tend to change the nature and character of the suit
to wide extent, it cannot be allowed. Under Order 6 Rule 17 of the

CRP 98/2017 Page 9 of 17
CPC the court may at any stage of the proceeding allow either party
to alter or amend his pleadings in such manner and on such terms as
may be just, and all such amendments shall be made as may be
necessary for the puroose of determining the real questions in
controversy between the parties. Provided that no application for
amendment shall be allowed after the tnal has commenced, unless the
Court comes to the conclusion that in spite of due diligence, the party
could not have raised the matter before the commencement of trial.
(17) Needless to say that on the strength of the aforesaid
provision, a party cannot seek amendment of his pleadings so as to
project altogether a different case than the one which was projected
in the suit. In the instant case as noted above, the whole basis of the
Claim of the plaintiff/petitioner to Schedule A and B properties is the
Will executed on 30.04.77. Now by the amended pleadings he seeks
to incorporate the properties purportedly come to his share being the
member of the Hindu undivided family. While doing so, he has not

abandoned the properties enumerated in Schedule A and B.”

19) In this regard, this Court has no disagreement with the ratio of the
case of Ku/bir Singh ( supra). However, in this case, the PWs has not been filed.
The plaint was amended vide order dated 23.05.2016. and the plaint was then
sought to be amended by filing petition on 09.08.2016. Therefore, there appears
to be no lack of due diligence on part of the petitioner. Moreover, as stated
above, the plaint is required to be amended once a defendant is added.
Therefore, the facts of this case are different from the one in Ku/Obir Singh

( supra).

20) It must be re-stated that the learned trial court had held that “/f the
amendment of the plaint was allowed it would change the nature and character
of the plaint and that at most, the plaintiff may be advised to bring a seoarate

suit to challenge the deed of compromise, subject to provisions of law.” \|n this

CRP 98/2017 Page 10 of 17
regard, the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of (i) Sampath Kumar (supra) and
(ii) Rajesh Kumar Aggarwal (supra), has held that if the party is permitted to file
a fresh suit then why he should not be permitted to amend the plaint. The
relevant paragraphs are quoted below:(i) Sampath Kumar (supra), para 6 to 12:
“6. [t Is true that the plaintiff on the averments made in
the application for amendment proposes to introduce a cause of
action which has arisen to the plaintiff during the pendency of
the suit, According to the defendant the averments made in the
qgoolication for amendment are factually incorrect and the
defendant was not in possession of the property since before
the institution of the suit itself.
7. /n our opinion, the basic structure of the sult is not
altered by the proposed amendment. What is sought to be
changed is the nature of relief sought for by the plaintiff. In the
opinion of the Trial Court it was open to the plaintiff to file a fresh
sult and that Is one of the reasons which has prevailed with the
Tnal Court and with the High Court in refusing the prayer for
amendment and also in dismissing the plaintiff s revision. We fail
to understand, if it is permissible for the plaintiff to file an
Independent sult, why the same relief which could be prayed for
in a new suit cannot be permitted to be incorporated in the
penaing suit. [n the facts and circumstances of the present case,
allowing the amendment would curtail multioliaty of legal
proceedings.
é. /n Mst. Rukhmabal Vs. Lala Laxminarayan & Ors. A/R
1960 SC 335, this Court has taken the view that where a suit was
filed without seeking an appropriate relief, it Is a well settled rule
of practice not to dismiss the suit automatically but to allow the

Plaintiff to make necessary amendment if he seeks to do so.

CRP 98/2017 Page 11 of 17
LS) Order 6 Rule 17 of the CPC confers jurisaiction on the
Court to allow either party to alter or amend his pleadings at any
stage of the proceedings and on such terms as may be just. Such
amendments as are directed towards putting-forth and seeking
determination of the real questions in controversy between the
parties shall be permitted to be made. The question of delay in
moving an application for amendment should be decided not by
calculating the period from the date of institution of the suit alone
but by reference to the stage to which the hearing in the suit has
proceeded. Pre-trial amendments are allowed more liberally than
those which are sought to be made after the commencement of
the trial or after conclusion thereof. /n former case generally it
can be assumed that the defendant is not prejudiced because he
Will have full opportunity of meeting the case of the plaintiff as
amended. In the latter cases the question of prejudice to the
opposite party may arise and that shall have to be answered by
reference to the facts and circumstances of each individual case.
No strait-jacket formula can be laid’ down. The fact remains that
a mere delay cannot be a ground for refusing a prayer for
amenament.

10. An amendment once incorporated relates back to the
date of the suit. However, the doctrine of relation back in the
context of amendment of pleadings is not one of universal
qaopolication and in aooroponate cases the Court is cormpetent while
permitting an amendment to airect that the amendment
permitted by it shall not relate back to the date of the suit and to
the extent permitted by it shall be deemed to have been brought
before the Court on the date on which the application seeking the
amendment was filed (See observations in Siddalingamma and
Anr. Vs. Mamtha Shenoy - (2001) 8 SCC 561).

CRP 98/2017 Page 12 of 17
11. [n the present case the amendment is being sought
for almost 11 years after the date of the institution of the suit.
The plaintiff is not debarred from instituting a new sult seeking
relief of declaration of title and recovery of possession on the
same basic facts as are pleaded in the plaint seeking relief of
Issuance of permanent prohibitory injunction and which Is
pending. !n order to avoid multiplicity of suits it would be a sound
exercise of alscretion to permit the relief of decaration of title
and recovery of possession being sought for in the pending sult.
The plaintiff has alleged the cause of action for the reliefs now
sought to be added as having arisen to him during the pendency
of the suit. The merits of the averments sought to be
incorporated by way of amendment are not to be judged at the
stage of allowing prayer for amendment. However, the defendant
Is night in submitting that if he has already perfected his title by
way of adverse possession then the right so accrued should not
be allowed to be defeated by permitting an arnendment and
seeking a new relief which would relate back to the date of the
suit and thereby deoriving the defendant of the advantage
accrued to him by lapse of time, by excluding a period of about
11 years in calculating the period of prescriptive title claimed to
have been earned by the defendant. The interest of the
defendant can be protected by directing that so far as the reliefs
of declaration of title and recovery of possession, now sought for,
are concerned the prayer in that regard shall be deemed to have
been made on the date on which the application for amendment
has been filed!

1? On the averments made in the application, the sarne
ought to have been allowed. If the facts alleged by plaintiff are
not correct it Is open for the defendant to take such plea in the

written statement and if the plaintiff fails in substantiating the

CRP 98/2017 Page 13 of 17
(Mi)

CRP 98/2017

factual averments and/or the defendant succeeds in
substantiating the plea which he would obviously be permitted to
raise in his pleading by way of consequential amendment then
the suit shall be lable to be dismissed. The defendant is not
prejudiced, more so when the amendment was sought for before
the commencement of the trial.”
Rajesh Kumar Aggarwal (supra), Para 14 to 19:
“14, Order 6 Rule 17 of CPC reads thus:
17) Amendment of Pleadings - The court may at
any stage of the proceedings allow either party to
alter or amend his pleadings in such manner and on
such terms as may be Just, and all such amendments
Shall be made as may be necessary for the purpose of
determining the real questions in controversy between
the parties:

Provided that no application for amendment
shall be allowed after the trial has commenced, unless
the Court comes to the conclusion that in soite of due
diligence, the party could not have raised the matter
before the commencement of trial.""

This rule declares that the Court may, at any stage of the
proceedings, allow either party to alter or amend his
pleadings in such a manner and on such terms as may be
Just. It also states that such amendments should be
necessary for the purpose of determining the real question in
controversy between the parties. The proviso enacts that no
qopolication for amendment should be allowed after the trial
has commenced, unless the Court comes to the conclusion
that in spite of due diligence, the party could not have raised
the matter for which amendment Is sought before the

commencement of the trial.”

Page 14 of 17
15. The object of the rule is that Courts should try
the merits of the case that come before them and should,
consequently, allow all amendments that may be necessary
for determining the real guestion in controversy between the
parties provided it does not cause injustice or prejudice to
the other side.

16. Order VI Rule 17 consist of two parts whereas

the first part Is discretionary (may) and leaves it to the

Court to order amendment of pleading. The second part Is

Imperative (shall) and eryoins the Court to allow all

amenaments which are necessary for the purpose of

determining the real question in controversy between the

parties.
17. /n our view, since the cause of action arose
during the pendency of the suit, proposed amendment ought
to have been granted because the basic structure of the suit
has not changed and that there was merely change in the
nature of relief Caimed. We fail to understand if it Is
permissible for the appellants to file an indeoendent suit,
why the same relief which could be prayed for in the new
suit cannot be permitted to be incorporated in the pending
sult.
18. As aliscussed above, the real controversy test Is
the basic or cardinal test and it is the primary duty of the
Court to decide whether such an amendment is necessary to
decide the real dispute between the parties. If it Is, the
amenament will be allowed; if it is not, the amendment will
be refused. On the contrary, the learned /udges of the High
Court without decding whether such an amendment Is
necessary has exoressed certain opinion and entered into a

aiscussion on merits of the amendment. /n cases like this,

CRP 98/2017 Page 15 of 17
the Court should also take notice of subsequent events in
order to shorten the litigation, to preserve and safeguard
rights of both parties and to sub-serve the ends of justice. /t
Is settled by catena of decisions of this Court that the rule of
amenament is essentially a rule of justice, equity and good
consaence and the power of amendment should be
exercised in the larger interest of doing full and complete

Justice to the parties before the Court.

19. While considering whether an application for
amenament should or should not be allowed, the Court
should not go into the correctness or falsity of the case in
the amendment. Likewise, it should not record a finding on
the merits of the amendment and the merits of the
amendment sought to be incorporated by way of
amendment are not to be adjudged at the stage of allowing
the prayer for amendment. This cardinal prinaple has not

been followed by the High Court in the instant case.”

21) Therefore, the observation by the learned trial court that the plaintiff
may be advised to bring a separate suit to challenge the deed of compromise is
found to be inconsistent with the ratio of the case of (i) Sarmoath Kumar (supra)

and (li) Rajesh Kumar Aggarwal (supra).

22) It has been held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in the case of
Rajesh Kumar Aggarwal (supra) that at the time of allowing or rejecting the
prayer for amendment, the court is not permitted to go into the correctness or
falsity of the case in the amendment and it should not record any finding on the
merit of the amendment, thus, this court is precluded from making any comment

on the merit of the proposed amendment as sought to be raised by the learned

CRP 98/2017 Page 16 of 17
Counsel for the Proforma Respondents No.11 to 14, as the same would be

decided at the time of trial.

23) In view of the above discussions, this court is of the considered
opinion that the impugned order passed by the learned trial court in rejecting the
proposed amendment on the grounds as narrated in paragraph 7 above appears
to be vitiated by jurisdictional error. Hence, this court has no hesitation in setting
aside the order dated 23.05.2016 passed by the Court of the learned Civil J udge
No.2, Kamrup (Metropolitan), Guwahati in Misc. J) Case No. 554/2016 arising
out of TS No. 216/2013.

24) Consequently, the application under Order VI Rule 17 CPC for
amendment of the plaint, which was numbered as petition No. 3840 and
registered as Misc. (J) Case No. 554/16 stands allowed. However, as the
proposed amendment has caused delay in the disposal of the suit, this Court
deems it fit to impose a cost of Rs.5,000/- (Rupees Five thousand only), to be
paid by the petitioner- plaintiff to the defendants and proforma defendants in the
suit, which shall be shared equally by them. Such cost would be deposited before
the learned trial court as a condition precedent for allowing the amendments to
be incorporated in the plaint, failing which the right to carry out the proposed

amendment shall stand forfeited.

25) The appearing parties who are duly represented by their respective
engaged counsels are directed to appear before the Court of the learned Civil
Judge No.2, Kamrup (Metropolitan), Guwahati, on 15.09.2017 without any
further notice and by submitting a certified copy of this order, shall seek further

Instructions from the said learned court.

thereby rejecting the application filed by the petitioner - plaintiff under Order VI

3) The petitioner - plaintiff had originally instituted the said suit against
the respondents No. 10 herein, out of which the respondents No.1 to 8 were
arrayed as Defendants No.1 to 8 and the respondents No. 9 and 10 herein were
arrayed as Proforma Defendants. The following reliefs were prayed in the plaint:
l. A decree for declaring that the revocation of Power-of-Attorney No.
1532/2002 dated 02.04.2002 vide Revocation of Power-of-Attorney
Deed No. 1850/2002 dated 18.04.2002 by the Defendant No. 1 and 3
illegal, null and void;

herein as Proforma Defendants, which was allowed by the learned trial court by
order dated 23.05.2016 and the said 5 (five) persons were arrayed as Proforma
Defendants No.11 to 15. The court is surprised to find that despite mention in
the cause title of the said petition that Late Birathi Nath was dead, yet the

learned trial court had permitted a dead person to be impleaded as a party in the

suit.

5) On 09.08.2016, the petitioner filed an application under Order VI Rule
17 CPC for amendment of the plaint, which was numbered as petition No. 3840
and registered as Misc. (J) Case No. 554/16. It was projected in the said petition
that during the pendency of the suit, it had come to the knowledge of the
petitioner that the Proforma Defendant No.10 had entered into a “Deed of Mutual
Compromise & Settlement” dated 15.12.2014 with Smt. Birathi Nath (since
deceased) and the respondents No.11 to 14 herein to sell a plot of land
measuring 5B-2K-9L covered by Dag No. 509, K.P. Patta No.20 of a particular
Village and Mouza (forming a part of land described in Schedule-A of the plaint).
Owing to the said subsequent development, the prayer for amendment of the

plaint was made.

6) In the meantime, the newly impleaded defendants No.12 to 15 (i.e.
respondents No. 11 to 14 herein) filed their written statement on 26.08.2016.
They also filed their written objection against the amendment petition on
08.12.2016.

7) The learned trial court, upon hearing the counsels for the appearing
parties, arrived at a finding that the petitioner- plaintiff was not a party to the
said agreement dated 15.12.2014 and that the amendment sought for was not
germane to the strife between the parties and that by the proposed amendment,
the petitioner herein was seeking to bring in the matter involving the Proforma
Defendants No.11 to 15 (i.e. deceased proforma defendant No.11 and Proforma
Respondents No.11 to 14 herein), which is beyond the scope of adjudication in a
suit for revocation for power of attorney executed by defendant No.1 and 2. It
was held that that it was a basic rule of every civil litigation that the rights of the
parties must be determined on the basis of the date of filing of the suit. It was

also held that if the amendment of the plaint was allowed it would change the

CRP 98/2017 Page 3 of 17
nature and character of the plaint and that at most, the plaintiff may be advised
to bring a separate suit to challenge the deed of compromise, subject to

provisions of law.

8) The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that while one of the
challenge in the plaint filed by the petitioner was that revocation of the Power of
Attorney No. 1532/2002 dated 02.04.2002 vide Revocation of Power of Attorney
Deed No. 1850/2002 by the defendant No.1 was illegal and void, if the mutual
settlement vide deed dated 15.12.2014 is not challenged and allowed to stand, in
the event, the said prayer in the plaint is decided in his favour, that decree would
stand frustrated. He has submitted that although Sri Pradip Prakash Das
(Proforma Defendant No.10) had signed the said agreement with the Proforma
Defendants No. 11 to 15, under clause 1 thereof, he was to receive the
consideration for the land mentioned thereunder and would distribute it amongst
the Defendants No.1 to 8 and Proforma Defendants No.9 and 10 and, as such,
the same was to frustrate the suit, where one of the reliefs was that the
revocation of the Power of Attorney by the defendants No.1 and 2 was illegal. It
is submitted that in the event the prayer (i) of the plaint was decreed, then the
right flowing in respect of the land covered by “Deed of Mutual Compromise &
Settlement dated 15.12.2014” would revert back to him. It is submitted that if
the petitioner is entitled to file a separate suit, then in order to shorten litigation
and to avoid multiplicity of litigation, it would be in the interest of justice to allow
the amendment of the plaint. It is submitted that the petition for amendment
was filed after issues were framed and before the plaintiff had submitted the
Evidence- On- Affidavit of the Plaintiff's Witnesses (PWs for short). In Support of
his argument, the learned counsel for the petitioner has relied on the case of (i)
Sampath Kumar Vs. Ayyakannu & Anr., (2002) 7 SCC 559, and (ii) Rajesh Kumar
Aggarwal & Ors. Vs. K.K. Modal, (2006) 4 SCC 385.

9) Per contra, the learned counsel for the respondent No.3 has argued in

support of the impugned order. It is submitted the prayer for challenging the

CRP 98/2017 Page 4 of 17
revocation of Power of Attorney was merely an incidental or alternative prayer
and the primary prayer of the petitioner- plaintiff was for recovery of a sum of
Rs.56,91,000/- from the defendants and a further sum of Rs.25,00,000/- as
compensation with 18% interest thereon. It is also submitted that in a suit
containing prayers as stated herein before, there is no way that a distinct cause
of action arising subsequently on 15.12.2014, when the “Deed of Mutual
Compromise & Settlement dated 15.12.2014” was entered, can be joined. Hence,
the suit would be bad for joinder of separate cause of action. If such amendment
was allowed, it would change the nature and character of the suit and would
enlarge the scope of the suit. In course of his argument, the learned counsel for
the respondent No.3 has referred to the stand taken by the parties in the plaint
and written statements, as well as in the petition for amendment and objection
filed thereto.

10) Also opposing the present application, the learned counsel for the
Respondents No.11 to 14 has also submitted that the respondents No. 11 to 14
had no involvement in the suit and, as such, they were strangers to the suit. It is
submitted that there were two distinct cause of action, which was sought to be
joined by the proposed amendment. By referring to the pleadings of the parties,
it is submitted that if the proposed amendment is allowed, it would change the
basic nature and character of the plaint. It was also submitted that the parties
between whom the “Deed of Mutual Compromise & Settlement dated
15.12.2014” was executed, were litigating before this Court in W.P.(C) No.
3909/2009 and after years of litigation, the parties viz., the Proforma Respondent
No.10 and Proforma Respondents No. 11 to 14 including Late Birathi Nath, with a
view to end the litigation had entered into a compromise and the proceedings of
W.P.(C) No. 3909/2009 had ended on compromise and, as such, it was
preposterous to allow the proposed amendment, which would question the
compromise done in the said writ petition. The learned counsel for the Proforma
Respondents No.11 to 14 had made an attempt to submit (i) about the past

litigation history, (li) various agreements relating to the suit land, and (lili)

CRP 98/2017 Page 5 of 17
whether the suit and reliefs claimed were barred by limitation, but as the subject
matter of this present application was limited to the challenge to the impugned
order by which amendment was refused, this court was disinclined to hear the
learned counsel for the Proforma Respondents No. 11 to 14 on those points. In
support of his argument, the learned counsel had relied on the case of (i)
Kanailal Das & Anr. Vs. /iban Kanal Das, A!R 1977 Cal 189, (ii) Kulbir Singh Vs.
Pritoal Shdev, 2011 (3) GLT 539.

11) This court has considered the arguments advanced by the learned

counsels for the appearing parties and the cases cited by them.

12) It appears that one of the finding by the learned trial court was that “/t
was a basic rule of every avi litigation that the rights of the parties must be
determined on the basis of the date of filing of the suit.” \f this finding is put to
test on the basis of a hypothetical subsequent event, say, in a suit for
confirmation of possession, the plaintiff is dispossessed from the suit land, then
whether he will be precluded from amending his plaint to seek recovery of
possession merely because the event of dispossession was a subsequent event
which is not relatable to the date of filing of the plaint or that it would change
the nature and character of the suit. The answer would be a emphatic ‘no’.
Therefore, in the case of amendment of plaint or written statement, there cannot
be a straight jacket formula which can be applied and each case must be tested

in the light of its unique facts.

13) The other finding by the learned trial court is that the petitioner was
not a party to the “Deed of Mutual Compromise & Settlement dated 15.12.2014”.
This is very true and no one has disputed this fact. One of the questions which is
required to be answered is whether in the event the suit as it stands in the
present form is decreed, whether the same would affect the land which is
covered by the said deed dated 15.12.2014. To answer this, one must refer to

the various plots of land described in Schedules A to G of the plaint. On a perusal

CRP 98/2017 Page 6 of 17
thereof, the plot of land measuring 5B-2K-9L, which is the subject matter of
Deed dated 15.12.2014, covered by Dag No. 509, K.P. Patta No.20 of a particular
Village and Mouza, finds mention in Schedule-A, Schedule-B, Schedule-E and
Schedule-G of the plaint. However, on a pointed query by this Court, the learned
counsel for the petitioner and Proforma Respondents No.11 to 14 are aa-idem
that the land mentioned in “Deed of Mutual Compromise & Settlement dated
15.12.2014” is covered by Schedule-B. The said version is accepted for the time
being and it is clarified that the same is not the finding by this court. Thus, if
prayer (i) happens to be decreed, it would result in revocation of Power of
Attorney being declared illegal and there is no doubt that the purported right of
the petitioner- plaintiff over land covered by the said Deed dated 15.12.2014

would stand revived.

14) Addressing the case of Kanailal Das (supra), cited by the learned
counsel for the Proforma Respondents No.11 to 14, it is seen that the various
principles for allowing amendment of the plaint are stated in paragraph 5
thereof, which is quoted below: 
“5) THE prinaples established by judicial decisions in respect of

amenament of plaint are as follows: 
(1) All amenaments will be generally permissible when they are
necessary for determination of the real controversy in the
sult.

(ii) All the same, substitution of one cause of action or the
nature of the claim for another in the orginal plaint or
change of the subject-matter of or controversy in the suit Is
not perrssible.

(ili) Introduction by amendment of inconsistent or contradictory
allegations in negation of the admitted position on facts, or
mutually destructive allegations of facts are also
Imopermissible though inconsistent pleas on the admitted

position can be introduced by way of amendment.

CRP 98/2017 Page 7 of 17
(iV) In general, the amendments should not cause prejudice to
the other side which cannot be cornoensated in costs.

(v) § Amendment of a caim or relief which ts barred by limitation
when the amendment Is sought to be made should not be
allowed to defeat a legal right accrued exceot when such
consideration is outweighed by the soecal arcurnstances of

the case.”

15) The learned counsel for the Proforma Respondents No.11 to 14 has
laid stress on sub-para (ii) of para 5. But in the case in hand, the petitioner is not
found to substitute the cause of action or the nature of the claim with another
and there appears to be no change in the subject matter of controversy, because
in the considered opinion of this Court, even if the amendment is permitted, it
would be in the aid of the basic relief under prayer (i) of the plaint as quoted
above. The “Deed of Mutual Compromise & Settlement dated 15.12.2014” Is
executed after the present suit was filed and, a challenge to the said deed is
found to be in aid to preserve the right of the petitioner- plaintiff, in the event
prayer (i) of the plaint is decreed. The Proforma Defendants No. 11 to 14 were
already brought on record by impleading them by order dated 23.05.2016.
Thereafter, the plaint is sought to be amended by petition filed on 09.08.2016.

16) Ideally, under the provisions of Order 1 Rule 10(4) CPC, when a
defendant is added, the plaint is required to be amended, unless court otherwise
directs, and it is provided that amended copies of summons and of the plaint
Shall be served on the newly impleaded defendants. In this regard, the provisions
of Order | Rule 10(4) CPC are quoted below:‘Order | Rule 10(4) Where defendant added, plaint to be
amended. - Where a defendant Is added, the plaint shall, unless the
court otherwise airects, be amended in such manner as may be

necessary, and amended copies of the summons and of the plaint

CRP 98/2017 Page 8 of 17
Shall be served on the new defendant and, if the court thinks fit on

the original defendant. ”

17) Therefore, notwithstanding the provisions of Order VI Rule 17 CPC,
this Court is of the considered opinion that on impleading of defendant in a suit,
the plaintiff has yet another legal opportunity to amend the plaint, which is not

bound by the rigours of the provisions of Order VI Rule 17 CPC.

18) This court in the case of Ku/Oir Singh (supra), cited by the learned
counsel for the Proforma Respondents No.11 to 14, has held that no amendment
Should be allowed after the trial has commenced unless the court comes to a
finding that in spite of due diligence, the party could not have raised the matter
before the commencement of trial and it was further held that a party cannot
seek amendment of his pleadings so as to project altogether a different case
then one projected in the suit. The relevant paragraph 15, 16 and 17 are quoted
below: “(15) The amendment petition was filed after long 16 years of
filing of the sult with the aforesaid statements and prayer. It Is in this
context, learned Trial Court has held that there was lack of due
diligence and that if the amendments are allowed, same would cause
prejudice to the defendants/ respondents. /t has also been observed
that the amendment would change the very basis of the claim of the
petitioner /plaintiff in the suit and consequently would lead to change
in the nature and character of the suit.
(16) While it is true that as per the principles of law laid’ down in
different decisions relating to prayer for amendment during the
pendency of the suit and the stages thereof, a liberal approach Is
required to be adopted: However, at the sarne time, it will have to be
considered in the context of the nature and character of the suit. If
the amendments tend to change the nature and character of the suit
to wide extent, it cannot be allowed. Under Order 6 Rule 17 of the

CRP 98/2017 Page 9 of 17
CPC the court may at any stage of the proceeding allow either party
to alter or amend his pleadings in such manner and on such terms as
may be just, and all such amendments shall be made as may be
necessary for the puroose of determining the real questions in
controversy between the parties. Provided that no application for
amendment shall be allowed after the tnal has commenced, unless the
Court comes to the conclusion that in spite of due diligence, the party
could not have raised the matter before the commencement of trial.
(17) Needless to say that on the strength of the aforesaid
provision, a party cannot seek amendment of his pleadings so as to
project altogether a different case than the one which was projected
in the suit. In the instant case as noted above, the whole basis of the
Claim of the plaintiff/petitioner to Schedule A and B properties is the
Will executed on 30.04.77. Now by the amended pleadings he seeks
to incorporate the properties purportedly come to his share being the
member of the Hindu undivided family. While doing so, he has not

abandoned the properties enumerated in Schedule A and B.”

19) In this regard, this Court has no disagreement with the ratio of the
case of Ku/bir Singh ( supra). However, in this case, the PWs has not been filed.
The plaint was amended vide order dated 23.05.2016. and the plaint was then
sought to be amended by filing petition on 09.08.2016. Therefore, there appears
to be no lack of due diligence on part of the petitioner. Moreover, as stated
above, the plaint is required to be amended once a defendant is added.
Therefore, the facts of this case are different from the one in Ku/Obir Singh

( supra).

20) It must be re-stated that the learned trial court had held that “/f the
amendment of the plaint was allowed it would change the nature and character
of the plaint and that at most, the plaintiff may be advised to bring a seoarate

suit to challenge the deed of compromise, subject to provisions of law.” \|n this

CRP 98/2017 Page 10 of 17
regard, the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of (i) Sampath Kumar (supra) and
(ii) Rajesh Kumar Aggarwal (supra), has held that if the party is permitted to file
a fresh suit then why he should not be permitted to amend the plaint. The
relevant paragraphs are quoted below:(i) Sampath Kumar (supra), para 6 to 12:
“6. [t Is true that the plaintiff on the averments made in
the application for amendment proposes to introduce a cause of
action which has arisen to the plaintiff during the pendency of
the suit, According to the defendant the averments made in the
qgoolication for amendment are factually incorrect and the
defendant was not in possession of the property since before
the institution of the suit itself.
7. /n our opinion, the basic structure of the sult is not
altered by the proposed amendment. What is sought to be
changed is the nature of relief sought for by the plaintiff. In the
opinion of the Trial Court it was open to the plaintiff to file a fresh
sult and that Is one of the reasons which has prevailed with the
Tnal Court and with the High Court in refusing the prayer for
amendment and also in dismissing the plaintiff s revision. We fail
to understand, if it is permissible for the plaintiff to file an
Independent sult, why the same relief which could be prayed for
in a new suit cannot be permitted to be incorporated in the
penaing suit. [n the facts and circumstances of the present case,
allowing the amendment would curtail multioliaty of legal
proceedings.
é. /n Mst. Rukhmabal Vs. Lala Laxminarayan & Ors. A/R
1960 SC 335, this Court has taken the view that where a suit was
filed without seeking an appropriate relief, it Is a well settled rule
of practice not to dismiss the suit automatically but to allow the

Plaintiff to make necessary amendment if he seeks to do so.

CRP 98/2017 Page 11 of 17
LS) Order 6 Rule 17 of the CPC confers jurisaiction on the
Court to allow either party to alter or amend his pleadings at any
stage of the proceedings and on such terms as may be just. Such
amendments as are directed towards putting-forth and seeking
determination of the real questions in controversy between the
parties shall be permitted to be made. The question of delay in
moving an application for amendment should be decided not by
calculating the period from the date of institution of the suit alone
but by reference to the stage to which the hearing in the suit has
proceeded. Pre-trial amendments are allowed more liberally than
those which are sought to be made after the commencement of
the trial or after conclusion thereof. /n former case generally it
can be assumed that the defendant is not prejudiced because he
Will have full opportunity of meeting the case of the plaintiff as
amended. In the latter cases the question of prejudice to the
opposite party may arise and that shall have to be answered by
reference to the facts and circumstances of each individual case.
No strait-jacket formula can be laid’ down. The fact remains that
a mere delay cannot be a ground for refusing a prayer for
amenament.

10. An amendment once incorporated relates back to the
date of the suit. However, the doctrine of relation back in the
context of amendment of pleadings is not one of universal
qaopolication and in aooroponate cases the Court is cormpetent while
permitting an amendment to airect that the amendment
permitted by it shall not relate back to the date of the suit and to
the extent permitted by it shall be deemed to have been brought
before the Court on the date on which the application seeking the
amendment was filed (See observations in Siddalingamma and
Anr. Vs. Mamtha Shenoy - (2001) 8 SCC 561).

CRP 98/2017 Page 12 of 17
11. [n the present case the amendment is being sought
for almost 11 years after the date of the institution of the suit.
The plaintiff is not debarred from instituting a new sult seeking
relief of declaration of title and recovery of possession on the
same basic facts as are pleaded in the plaint seeking relief of
Issuance of permanent prohibitory injunction and which Is
pending. !n order to avoid multiplicity of suits it would be a sound
exercise of alscretion to permit the relief of decaration of title
and recovery of possession being sought for in the pending sult.
The plaintiff has alleged the cause of action for the reliefs now
sought to be added as having arisen to him during the pendency
of the suit. The merits of the averments sought to be
incorporated by way of amendment are not to be judged at the
stage of allowing prayer for amendment. However, the defendant
Is night in submitting that if he has already perfected his title by
way of adverse possession then the right so accrued should not
be allowed to be defeated by permitting an arnendment and
seeking a new relief which would relate back to the date of the
suit and thereby deoriving the defendant of the advantage
accrued to him by lapse of time, by excluding a period of about
11 years in calculating the period of prescriptive title claimed to
have been earned by the defendant. The interest of the
defendant can be protected by directing that so far as the reliefs
of declaration of title and recovery of possession, now sought for,
are concerned the prayer in that regard shall be deemed to have
been made on the date on which the application for amendment
has been filed!

1? On the averments made in the application, the sarne
ought to have been allowed. If the facts alleged by plaintiff are
not correct it Is open for the defendant to take such plea in the

written statement and if the plaintiff fails in substantiating the

CRP 98/2017 Page 13 of 17
(Mi)

CRP 98/2017

factual averments and/or the defendant succeeds in
substantiating the plea which he would obviously be permitted to
raise in his pleading by way of consequential amendment then
the suit shall be lable to be dismissed. The defendant is not
prejudiced, more so when the amendment was sought for before
the commencement of the trial.”
Rajesh Kumar Aggarwal (supra), Para 14 to 19:
“14, Order 6 Rule 17 of CPC reads thus:
17) Amendment of Pleadings - The court may at
any stage of the proceedings allow either party to
alter or amend his pleadings in such manner and on
such terms as may be Just, and all such amendments
Shall be made as may be necessary for the purpose of
determining the real questions in controversy between
the parties:

Provided that no application for amendment
shall be allowed after the trial has commenced, unless
the Court comes to the conclusion that in soite of due
diligence, the party could not have raised the matter
before the commencement of trial.""

This rule declares that the Court may, at any stage of the
proceedings, allow either party to alter or amend his
pleadings in such a manner and on such terms as may be
Just. It also states that such amendments should be
necessary for the purpose of determining the real question in
controversy between the parties. The proviso enacts that no
qopolication for amendment should be allowed after the trial
has commenced, unless the Court comes to the conclusion
that in spite of due diligence, the party could not have raised
the matter for which amendment Is sought before the

commencement of the trial.”

Page 14 of 17
15. The object of the rule is that Courts should try
the merits of the case that come before them and should,
consequently, allow all amendments that may be necessary
for determining the real guestion in controversy between the
parties provided it does not cause injustice or prejudice to
the other side.

16. Order VI Rule 17 consist of two parts whereas

the first part Is discretionary (may) and leaves it to the

Court to order amendment of pleading. The second part Is

Imperative (shall) and eryoins the Court to allow all

amenaments which are necessary for the purpose of

determining the real question in controversy between the

parties.
17. /n our view, since the cause of action arose
during the pendency of the suit, proposed amendment ought
to have been granted because the basic structure of the suit
has not changed and that there was merely change in the
nature of relief Caimed. We fail to understand if it Is
permissible for the appellants to file an indeoendent suit,
why the same relief which could be prayed for in the new
suit cannot be permitted to be incorporated in the pending
sult.
18. As aliscussed above, the real controversy test Is
the basic or cardinal test and it is the primary duty of the
Court to decide whether such an amendment is necessary to
decide the real dispute between the parties. If it Is, the
amenament will be allowed; if it is not, the amendment will
be refused. On the contrary, the learned /udges of the High
Court without decding whether such an amendment Is
necessary has exoressed certain opinion and entered into a

aiscussion on merits of the amendment. /n cases like this,

CRP 98/2017 Page 15 of 17
the Court should also take notice of subsequent events in
order to shorten the litigation, to preserve and safeguard
rights of both parties and to sub-serve the ends of justice. /t
Is settled by catena of decisions of this Court that the rule of
amenament is essentially a rule of justice, equity and good
consaence and the power of amendment should be
exercised in the larger interest of doing full and complete

Justice to the parties before the Court.

19. While considering whether an application for
amenament should or should not be allowed, the Court
should not go into the correctness or falsity of the case in
the amendment. Likewise, it should not record a finding on
the merits of the amendment and the merits of the
amendment sought to be incorporated by way of
amendment are not to be adjudged at the stage of allowing
the prayer for amendment. This cardinal prinaple has not

been followed by the High Court in the instant case.”

21) Therefore, the observation by the learned trial court that the plaintiff
may be advised to bring a separate suit to challenge the deed of compromise is
found to be inconsistent with the ratio of the case of (i) Sarmoath Kumar (supra)

and (li) Rajesh Kumar Aggarwal (supra).

22) It has been held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in the case of
Rajesh Kumar Aggarwal (supra) that at the time of allowing or rejecting the
prayer for amendment, the court is not permitted to go into the correctness or
falsity of the case in the amendment and it should not record any finding on the
merit of the amendment, thus, this court is precluded from making any comment

on the merit of the proposed amendment as sought to be raised by the learned

CRP 98/2017 Page 16 of 17
Counsel for the Proforma Respondents No.11 to 14, as the same would be

decided at the time of trial.

23) In view of the above discussions, this court is of the considered
opinion that the impugned order passed by the learned trial court in rejecting the
proposed amendment on the grounds as narrated in paragraph 7 above appears
to be vitiated by jurisdictional error. Hence, this court has no hesitation in setting
aside the order dated 23.05.2016 passed by the Court of the learned Civil J udge
No.2, Kamrup (Metropolitan), Guwahati in Misc. J) Case No. 554/2016 arising
out of TS No. 216/2013.

24) Consequently, the application under Order VI Rule 17 CPC for
amendment of the plaint, which was numbered as petition No. 3840 and
registered as Misc. (J) Case No. 554/16 stands allowed. However, as the
proposed amendment has caused delay in the disposal of the suit, this Court
deems it fit to impose a cost of Rs.5,000/- (Rupees Five thousand only), to be
paid by the petitioner- plaintiff to the defendants and proforma defendants in the
suit, which shall be shared equally by them. Such cost would be deposited before
the learned trial court as a condition precedent for allowing the amendments to
be incorporated in the plaint, failing which the right to carry out the proposed

amendment shall stand forfeited.

25) The appearing parties who are duly represented by their respective
engaged counsels are directed to appear before the Court of the learned Civil
Judge No.2, Kamrup (Metropolitan), Guwahati, on 15.09.2017 without any
further notice and by submitting a certified copy of this order, shall seek further

Instructions from the said learned court.

authority or jurisdiction and also has power to interfere with the
finding of fact, manifest misreading of evidence thereby indulging in
improper exercise of jurisdiction or if its conclusions are perverse. (1998) 8 SCC 1 to project that High Court had power, discretion and
prerogative to issue writs under Article 227 of the Constitution of India
when there was violation of principles of natural justice and also when
the order was wholly without jurisdiction. Union of
Inala, (2004) 4 SCC 311, as such, it is not open for the learned counsels for the
petitioners to submit that the remedy as provided under the SARFAESI! It is submitted that it is too absurd to even think that there is no

CRP 439/16 & CRP 81/17 Page 5 of 12
dispensation of real justice by the learned DRT or the learned DRAT as projected,
but as there was no merit in the case of the petitioners, they have approached
this court to prolong the matter and to cause delay in the enforcement of
security interest by the respondents No.1 and 2. Thus, for all intents and purpose, when a valuer is

empanelled, such empanelled persons are also called ‘approved valuer’. Considered the submissions made by the learned Counsels for the

parties as well as the various cases cited by them. But, merely because the valuation report contains value of movable
property worth Rs.67,000/-, the same is not so glaring that it can shock the
conscience of the Court so as to scuttle the attempt of the secured creditor to
Sale security asset in form of immovable property valued at Rs.1,70,44,000/(Rupees One Crore Seventy lakh forty four thousand only), being a portion of
total dues of Rs.4,19,10,110.88 (Rupees Four Crore nineteen lakh ten thousand
one hundred ten and paise eighty eight only) as on 01.08.2016 from the

petitioners. The challenge made in the present application appears to be the
procedural facet only, involving appointment of ‘approved valuer’ and the
valuation report containing column showing that some movable assets have also
been valued and the value thereof is shown as Rs.67,000/-. These are not such
matters, which the learned DRAT cannot adjudicate. It was argued that
owing to the provisions contained in Gujarat Talugqdari Abolition Act,
1949 there was finality to appellate order and therefore, the High
Court ought not to have interfered with the order under Article 227 of
the Constitution of India. Thus, the matter was directly related to the
administration of justice. Therefore, even in this case, the Hon'ble
Bombay High Court was not hearing any challenge to the original
judicial order. In this context, it was held that the availability
of alternative remedy was not a bar for the High Court to exercise
discretionary jurisdiction to entertain writ petition. In this case, the
Hon'ble High Court was not hearing any challenge to the original
judicial order under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. Rather,

in the case of Satyawati Tondon (supra), the direction was issued to

CRP 439/16 & CRP 81/17 Page 11 of 12
the High Courts to exercise their discretion in such matters with

greater caution, care and circumspection. For the reasons discussed above, the two applications filed by the
petitioners are not maintainable due to existence of alternative and efficacious
remedy, which in terms of the case of Satyawati Tondon (supra), is required to

be exhausted first. In case the petitioners prefer any appeal(s) as provided under Section
18 of the SARFAESI Act within a outer limit of 30 days from today, the limitation
provided under Section 18(1) thereof shall stand extended as the petitioners had
been bona fide litigating before this Court. With the above observations, these two applications stand dismissed.","THE GAUHATI HIGH COURT

Heard Mr. O.P. Bhati, the learned Counsel for the petitioner, Mr. S.
Dutta, the learned Counsel for the respondents No.1 and 2 as well as Mr. A. Das,

the learned Counsel for the respondent No.3.

2. At the outset, the learned Counsels appearing for the respondents has
raised the issue of maintainability of both the present revisions on the ground
that against the orders passed by the Debts Recovery Tribunal, Guwahati (DRT
for short), there exists an alternative and efficacious remedy available to the
petitioners by filing an appeal as provided in Section 18 of the Securitization And

Reconstruction of Financial Assets And Enforcement of Security Interest Act,

CRP 439/16 & CRP 81/17 Page 1 of 12
2002 (“SARFAESI Act” for short). Hence, instead of entertaining the present
revision, the petitioners may be directed to move the appellate forum. Thus, this
Court had heard the learned Counsels for the parties on the preliminary issue

raised by the respondents.

3. The brief introductory case of the parties is that the respondents No.1
and 2, |.e. IDBI Bank Ltd. and its Authorized Officer had taken steps under the
Securitisation And Reconstruction of Financial Assets And Enforcement of
Security Interest Act, 2002 (“SARFAESI Act” for short), against the petitioners for
enforcing recovery of a sum of Rs.4,19,10,110.88 (Rupees Four Crore nineteen
lakh ten thousand one hundred ten and paise eighty eight only) as on

01.08.2016, as appears from the sale notice published in the newspapers.

4. Against notice dated 17.04.2014 issued under Section 13(2) of the
SARFAESI Act, and possession notice dated 06.06.2016 issued under Section
13(12) of the SARFAESI Act, the petitioners approached the Debts Recovery
Tribunal, Guwahati (DRT for short). The application filed by the petitioners was
registered as Application (SARFAESI) No. 50/2016. Thereafter, during the
pendency of the said application, on 28.08.2016, a public notice for sale of
immovable properties of the respondents No.1 and 2 was published in the
newspapers. The reserve price of the immovable property described in the said
notice was Rs.1,70,44,000/- (Rupees One Crore Seventy lakh forty four thousand
only). The petitioners challenged the said notice before the learned DRT by filing
an application under Section 17 of the SARFAESI Act, which was numbered as
Application (SAFAESI) No. 78/2016.

5. In connection with Application (SAFAESI) No. 78/2016, the petitioners
had filed M.A. No. 155/2016, praying before the learned DRT to restrain the
respondents No.1 and 2 herein from selling the mortgaged properties pursuant to
the notice of sale dated 28.08.2016. The prayer was based on the projection that

no provision was made for the safe custody of movable properties, the value of

CRP 439/16 & CRP 81/17 Page 2 of 12
the property as submitted by the empanelled valuer does not depict the true
valuation and that the empanelled valuer was not a approved valuer within the
meaning of Rule 2(d) of the Security Interest (Enforcement) Rules, 2002
(“SAFAESI Rules” for short), 2002. The said misc. application was dismissed by
the learned DRT by order dated 25.10.2016, which is the subject matter of
challenge in CRP 439/2016, which has been filed under Article 227 of the

Constitution of India.

6. Thereafter, the entire matter was heard and by order dated
03.02.2017, the learned DRT dismissed (i) Application (SAFAESI) No. 50/2016,
(ii) Application (SAFAESI) No. 78/2016, (ili) M.A. No. 151/16, and (iv) M.A. No.
112/16 filed by the Petitioners. The said order is the subject matter of challenge
in CRP 81/2017, which has been filed under Article 227 of the Constitution of

India.

7. The learned Counsel for the petitioner has submitted that 
a. The provisions of Rule 2(d) of SARFAESI Rules provides for “approved
valuer”, and it required that the valuer must be approved by the Board
of Directors or Board of Trustees of the secured creditor. By relying on
the documents filed in this application, it is submitted that the ‘valuer’
who had valued the assets was merely an “empanelled valuer’, which
was not done by the Board of Directors or Board of Trustees of the
secured creditor, but by an officer of the Bank.

b. It is submitted that although by the sale notice only sale of immovable
properties was advertised, but the valuation report showed that it
contains the value of some movable assets also.

c. It is submitted that under Rule 8(5) of the SARFAESI Rules, it was the
duty of the respondents No.1 and 2 to obtain a valuation from an
approved valuer. Therefore, there has been violation of the statutory
Rules, and as the learned DRT did not take notice of such glaring

errors and violation of the provisions of SARFAES! Rules that the

CRP 439/16 & CRP 81/17 Page 3 of 12
learned DRT had acted illegally, and failed to exercise jurisdiction
vested in it by law and the impugned orders amounted to
acquiescence of violation of SARFAES! Rules and, as such, the
impugned orders suffered from the vice of jurisdictional error.

d. It is further submitted by the learned Counsel for the petitioners that
he was only making submissions on the preliminary issue raised by the
learned counsels for the respondents and was therefore, reserving his

right to argue on merit, if called upon to do so.

3. In support of his argument, the learned Counsel for the petitioners has
relied on the following cases and submitted as follows:
l. Mathew Verghese Vs. M Amnitha Kumar & Ors., (2014) 5 SCC 610 to
project that Rules 8 and 9 of the SARFAESI Rules were mandatory.

ll. State of West Bengal Vs. Samar Kumar Sarkar, (2009) 15 SCC 444 to
project that under the provisions of Article 227 of the Constitution of
India, this Court had power of exercising superintending jurisdiction
over all Courts and Tribunals including the DRT and, as such, it is
Submitted that merely because there was a remedy of appeal, the
jurisdiction of this Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India
cannot be ousted because the complain in the present case is about
violation of SARFAESI Rules.

lil. State of Gujarat Vs. Vakhtsinghyi Sursinghj! Vaghela & Ors., AlR 1968
SC 1481 (Constitution Bench), to project that the power of the High
Court cannot be fettered by any Act and the jurisdiction extends to
keeping the subordinate tribunals within the limits of their authority
and to see that they obey law.

iv. Achutananda Baidlya Vs. Pratullya Kumar Gayen & Ors., (1997) 5 SCC
76 to project that the High Court can interfere under Article 227 of the
Constitution of India in cases of erroneous assumption of jurisdiction,
for acting beyond its jurisdiction, refusal to exercise jurisdiction, error

apparent on the face of record, arbitrary or capricious exercise of

CRP 439/16 & CRP 81/17 Page 4 of 12
authority or jurisdiction and also has power to interfere with the
finding of fact, manifest misreading of evidence thereby indulging in
improper exercise of jurisdiction or if its conclusions are perverse.

v. Union of India & Ors. Vs. Debts Recovery Bar Association And Anr.,
(2013) 2 SCC 574 to project that the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India
has held therein that the High Courts are empowered to exercise
jurisdiction over DRTs and DRATs to oversee their functioning.

vi. Whirloool Corporation Vs. Registrar of Trade Marks, Mumbai & Ors.,
(1998) 8 SCC 1 to project that High Court had power, discretion and
prerogative to issue writs under Article 227 of the Constitution of India
when there was violation of principles of natural justice and also when
the order was wholly without jurisdiction.

vil. Committee of Management and Another Vs. Vice Chancellor & Ors.,
AIR 2009 SC 1159 to project that when there was violation of
principles of natural justice and alSo when the order was wholly
without jurisdiction the High Court would interfere and such power can

be exercised despite alternative remedy being available.

9. It is submitted that the alternative remedy is not available within the
State and moreover, the limited remedy available by way of appeal amounted to
no remedy at all and, as such, the alternative remedy of appeal was neither
efficacious nor the learned DRT or the learned DRAT is inclined to hear any
borrower and to give real justice, which, according to the learned counsel for the

petitioner, could be seen in the present case in hand.

10. Per contra, the learned counsel for the respondents has submitted
that the Constitutionality of SARFAESI Act and SARFAESI Rules has been upheld
by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Mardia Chemicals Ltd! Vs. Union of
Inala, (2004) 4 SCC 311, as such, it is not open for the learned counsels for the
petitioners to submit that the remedy as provided under the SARFAESI! Act was

not efficacious. It is submitted that it is too absurd to even think that there is no

CRP 439/16 & CRP 81/17 Page 5 of 12
dispensation of real justice by the learned DRT or the learned DRAT as projected,
but as there was no merit in the case of the petitioners, they have approached
this court to prolong the matter and to cause delay in the enforcement of
security interest by the respondents No.1 and 2. It is submitted that efficacious

alternative remedy is provided for under the SARFAESI Act.

11. The learned Counsels for the respondents submit that they do not
dispute that this Court has the power and jurisdiction to issue writs under Article
226 of the Constitution of India and powers to interfere with any orders passed
by subordinate DRT and DRAT. They admit the ratio of the cases referred to by
the learned Counsel for the petitioner, but submit that this was a case where this
Court should exercise self-restraint because the respondents No.1 and 2 are in
the process of realizing its debts from the petitioners amounting to
Rs.4,19,10,110.88 (Rupees Four Crore nineteen lakh ten thousand one hundred
ten and paise eighty eight only) as on 01.08.2016 and by their continued
challenge to the various steps taken by the respondents No.1 and 2, the sale of
immovable property, which was advertised on 28.08.2016 could not materialized

even after expiry of over a year now.

12. It is submitted that they had been able to demonstrate before the
learned DRT that there are delegation of powers by the Board of Directors to its
various levels of officers so that the business of the bank goes on smoothly and
that they have produced a copy of the resolution adopted by the Board of
Directors in its meeting held on 12.02.2016 by which the current ‘Delegation of
Power” had been approved, accordingly, under SI. No. 36, the General Manager
(Business), RBG Zone and Deputy General Manager, General Manager, NMG
Zone were empowered to empanel any external agencies for recovery and
operational matters. Thus, for all intents and purpose, when a valuer is

empanelled, such empanelled persons are also called ‘approved valuer’.

CRP 439/16 & CRP 81/17 Page 6 of 12
13. The learned counsel for the respondents rely on the case of United
Bank of India Vs. Satyawati Tonaon & Ors., (2010) 8 SCC 110, where the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India has expressed its concern of interfering with the orders
of the learned DRT and learned DRAT by the High Court by ignoring the nonexhausting of statutory remedies. Hence, it is submitted that the present
applications under Article 227 of the Constitution of India be dismissed, leaving it

open for the petitioners to seek appropriate remedy as may be available to them.

14. Considered the submissions made by the learned Counsels for the

parties as well as the various cases cited by them.

15. There is no dispute that under Article 227 of the Constitution of India,
this Court has the power as well as jurisdiction to exercise extra-ordinary
Superintending jurisdiction over all subordinate courts and Tribunals within its
jurisdiction. However, it would be relevant to quote the observation of the
Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in paragraph 42, 43 and 55 of the case of
Satyawati Tondon (supra):
‘42, There is another reason why the imougned order should be
set aside. /f Resoondent 1 had any tangible grievance against the
notice issued under Section 13(4) or action taken under Section 14,
then she could have availed remedy by filing an aoplication under
Section 17(1). The exoression “any person” used in Section 17(1) Is
of wide import. It takes within its fold, not only the borrower but
also the guarantor or any other person who may be affected by the
action taken under Section 13(4) or Section 14, Both, the Tribunal
and the Appellate Tribunal are empowered to pass interim orders
under Sections 17 and 18 and are required to decide the matters
within a fixed time schedule. /t is thus evident that the remedies
available to an aggrieved person under the SARFAES! Act are both

expeditious and effective.

CRP 439/16 & CRP 81/17 Page 7 of 12
43. Unfortunately, the High Court overlooked the settled law
that the High Court will ordinarily not entertain a petition under
Article 226 of the Constitution if an effective remedy Is available to
the aggrieved person and that this rule applies with greater rigour
in matters involving recovery of taxes, cess, fees, other tyoes of
public money and the dues of banks and other financial institutions.
/n our view, While dealing with the petitions involving challenge to
the action taken for recovery of the public dues, etc. the High Court
must keeo in mind that the legislations enacted by Parliament and
State Legislatures for recovery of such ques are a code unto
themselves inasmuch as they not only contain comprehensive
procedure for recovery of the dues but also envisage constitution of
guasi-/Uudical bodies for redressal of the grievance of any aggrieved
person. Therefore, in all such cases, the High Court must insist that
before availing remedy under Article 226 of the Constitution, a
person must exhaust the remedies available under the relevant
statute.

55. [tis a matter of serious concern that despite reoeated
pronouncement of this Court, the High Courts continue to ignore
the availability of statutory remeaies under the DRT Act and the
SARFAES! Act and exercise jurisdiction under Article 226 for passing
orders which have serious adverse impact on the nght of banks and
other financial institutions to recover their dues. We hope and trust
that in future the High Courts will exercise their discretion in such

matters with greater caution, care and circumspection. ”

16. This court cannot fail to notice that the value of movable assets like
plant and machinery is only Rs.67,000/-. Nevertheless, the sale notice dated
28.08.2016 was not in respect of movable assets. Therefore, the grievance raised
by the petitioners seems to be premature, and the petitioners can only raise a

valid challenge to the sale of movable properties, if it is actually sold. Moreover,

CRP 439/16 & CRP 81/17 Page 8 of 12
there is no bar for the petitioners to claim possession of movable assets by
offering adequate security or by paying the value thereof to the respondents
No.1 and 2. But, merely because the valuation report contains value of movable
property worth Rs.67,000/-, the same is not so glaring that it can shock the
conscience of the Court so as to scuttle the attempt of the secured creditor to
Sale security asset in form of immovable property valued at Rs.1,70,44,000/(Rupees One Crore Seventy lakh forty four thousand only), being a portion of
total dues of Rs.4,19,10,110.88 (Rupees Four Crore nineteen lakh ten thousand
one hundred ten and paise eighty eight only) as on 01.08.2016 from the

petitioners.

17. The challenge made in the present application appears to be the
procedural facet only, involving appointment of ‘approved valuer’ and the
valuation report containing column showing that some movable assets have also
been valued and the value thereof is shown as Rs.67,000/-. However, the sale
notice as published in the newspapers pertain only to immovable properties, as
such, there is no real threat to the right of the petitioners. These are not such
matters, which the learned DRAT cannot adjudicate. This Court finds that the
learned DRT had dealt with the issue raised by the petitioners that the provisions
of Rule 8 and 9 of the SARFAESI Rules have been violated and the said issue Is a
question of fact and the learned DRAT is the most competent appellate tribunal

to deal with the said issue.

18. The Constitutionality of the scheme of hearing under section 17 and
Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act has already been upheld. Therefore, this Court Is
not convinced that the remedy of appeal available before the learned DRAT is not
efficacious and complete. Hence, the petitioners must avail the statutory remedy
of appeal as envisaged under SARFAESI Act. This Court is of the view that the
ratio laid down in the case of Satyawati Tondon (supra) is required to be

followed in this case.

CRP 439/16 & CRP 81/17 Page 9 of 12
19, Coming to the cases cited by the learned Counsel for the petitioners:
a. In the case of Mathew Varghese (supra), the issue related to sale of
security asset in auction to the auction purchaser. The sale to the
auction purchaser was challenged in writ petition before the Hon’ble
Kerela High Court. Therefore, the matter was not taken up by the
Hon'ble High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India as a
challenge to the original order.

b. In the case of State of West Bengal (supra), the issue was that the
High Court had transferred the case filed under Section 19 of the
Administrative Tribunals Act and pending before the Administrative
Tribunal to the High Court for its consideration. The transfer order was
quashed and the case was directed to be tried by the Tribunal.

c. In the case of Vakhtsinghji Sursinghji Vaghela (supra) the matter
related to proceedings for claims for compensation and award passed
by the Special Deputy Commissioner. The consequent orders by
Bombay Revenue Tribunal was revised by the Hon'ble Gujarat High
Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. It was argued that
owing to the provisions contained in Gujarat Talugqdari Abolition Act,
1949 there was finality to appellate order and therefore, the High
Court ought not to have interfered with the order under Article 227 of
the Constitution of India. While considering the said statement, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in paragraph-16 thereof held that
“This surisaiction cannot be limited or fettered by any Act of the State
Legislature.” The SARFAESI Act is not a State Legislature. In this case
also, the matter was not taken up by the Hon’ble High Court as a
challenge to the original order, as sought to be done in the present
case.

d. In the case of Achutananda Baidya (supra) also the Hon'ble Calcutta
High Court was dealing with an appellate order passed by the SubDivisional Officer under the provisions of the West Bengal Restoration

of Alienated Land Act, 1973. The original order was passed by the

CRP 439/16 & CRP 81/17 Page 10 of 12
Special Officer constituted under the said Act. Therefore, here also,
the matter was not taken up by the Hon’ble High Court as a challenge
to the original order.

e. In the case of Debts Recovery Tribunal Bar Association (Supra), the
issue taken up by the Hon’ble High Court of Punjab & Haryana High
Court related to adequate space for the smooth functioning of DRT at
Chandigarh. Thus, the matter was directly related to the
administration of justice. It was in the said context that it was held
that High Court had supervisory jurisdiction over DRT and DRAT. The
Hon'ble High Court was not hearing any challenge to the original
judicial order.

f. The case of Whirlpool Corporation (Supra) did not arise out of orders
passed in Article 227 of the Constitution of India. The suvo-motu action
by the Registrar of Trade Marks was put to challenge under Article 226
of the Constitution of India. Therefore, even in this case, the Hon'ble
Bombay High Court was not hearing any challenge to the original
judicial order.

g. In the case of Committee of Management (supra), the management
had taken a decision to draw up disciplinary proceedings against the
respondent No.3 therein. The matter was challenged in writ
jurisdiction and not under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. The
remedy available to the concerned person was under U.P. State
Universities Act, 1973. In this context, it was held that the availability
of alternative remedy was not a bar for the High Court to exercise
discretionary jurisdiction to entertain writ petition. In this case, the
Hon'ble High Court was not hearing any challenge to the original
judicial order under Article 227 of the Constitution of India.

h. Thus, in none of the case, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India had
maintained a challenge to the order passed by DRT in an application
by the defaulter under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. Rather,

in the case of Satyawati Tondon (supra), the direction was issued to

CRP 439/16 & CRP 81/17 Page 11 of 12
the High Courts to exercise their discretion in such matters with

greater caution, care and circumspection.

20. Therefore, bound by the said ratio of the case of Satyawati Tondon
(supra), having visited the facts as narrated in this application, there appears to
be nothing on record to show that the learned DRT had usurped any power or
jurisdiction, or it had misread any evidence, or acted beyond its jurisdiction, or
illegally refused to exercise jurisdiction, or committed any error apparent on the
face of record, or had arbitrarily or capriciously exercised any power, or authority
or jurisdiction or otherwise indulged in improper exercise of jurisdiction or that
any of its conclusions are perverse. Therefore, if according to the learned counsel
for the petitioners, the decision of the learned DRT Is erroneous, the same Is
required to be assailed in appeal as provided for in Section 18 of the SARFAESI
Act.

21. For the reasons discussed above, the two applications filed by the
petitioners are not maintainable due to existence of alternative and efficacious
remedy, which in terms of the case of Satyawati Tondon (supra), is required to

be exhausted first.

22. In case the petitioners prefer any appeal(s) as provided under Section
18 of the SARFAESI Act within a outer limit of 30 days from today, the limitation
provided under Section 18(1) thereof shall stand extended as the petitioners had
been bona fide litigating before this Court.

23. With the above observations, these two applications stand dismissed.

The parties are left to bear their own cost.

JUDGMENT AND ORDER
(ORAL)

Heard Ms. P Baruah, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant.
Also heard Mr. S U Ahmed, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent.
2. It is submitted that the present appeals arose out of the notification dated
08.08.2008 in Land Acquisition case No.04/2007 issued by the Collector, Kamrup. By
way of the said notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, in
total 248 B OK 3L of land at village Hahara under Kamalpur Revenue circle was
acquired. The Collector assessed the valuation of the acquired land at Rs.2,30,000/lakhs only per bigha. The present respondents accepted the said sum under protest
and submitted applications to the Collector for referring the matters to the court by
claiming Rs.10 lakhs per bigha and additional compensation etc. Accordingly,
Reference Case Nos.12/2010 to 53/2010 were registered in the court of Additional
District J udge No.1, Kamrup, Guwahati. The said bunch of Reference Cases includes
the Reference Case Nos. 40/2010, 13/2010, 17/2010 and 49/2010. The said
Reference Cases were disposed of by the learned Reference Court vide common
judgment and award dated 22.11.2012. By way of the said judgment and award, the
claim of the petitioners in the Reference Case were enhanced by holding the value of
the land as Rs.7 lakhs per bigha with additional compensation at the rate of 12%
and 30 % under Section 23 (1)(a) and 23(2) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. The
present appellant, being aggrieved against the said judgment and awards passed in
the Reference Cases preferred Land Acquisition Appeal Nos. 18/2014 to land
Acquisition Appeal Nos.55/2014. Amongst the said bunches of the Land Acquisition

appeals, the present appeals were also included but owing to the death of the

LA. APP. 8/2017, LA. APP. 9/2017, LA. APP. 10/2017, LA. APP. 11/2017
Page No.4

respondents the same abated following which the present four appeals were
withdrawn instead of filing substitution petition to substitute the deceased
respondent by their legal heirs. Later on, the present counsel appearing on behalf of
the appellant realized the mistake and sought for review of the earlier order and
having set aside the earlier order and substitution of the legal heirs of the
deceased/respondents, the present four numbers of Land Acquisition Appeals are
registered afresh after condoning the delay and the same are taken up for disposal
today by way of the common judgment and order.

2. As indicated earlier, the left over Land Acquisition Appeals were disposed of by way
of common judgment dated 22.11.2012 whereby the appeals were allowed by determining
the market value of Rs.5,25,000/- only per bigha instead of Rs.7,00,000/- only per bigha as
determined by the learned Reference Court. Considering the same, this court accordingly
holds that the present appeals can be disposed of as the covered case of judgment dated
22.11.2012 passed by this Court in Land Acquisition Appeal Nos.19/2014 to Land
Acquisition Appeal Nos. 55/2014 including Land Acquisition Appeal No. 18/2014.

3. Accordingly, these appeals are disposed of as per the observation made hereinbove.
In view of the delay owing to the withdrawal of the said appeal wrongly, it is directed that
the revised awarded amount be disbursed to the respondents within a period of two months

from today. Send back the LCR.

SON OF AZIZ BHUYAN

RESIDENT OF VILLAGE CHAKIR BHITHA,
P.S & DIST : BARPETA (ASSAM). [2] Undisputed facts relevant for disposal of this appeal are that the husband
of the claimant Raizuddin died in a motor vehicle accident involving vehicle No. AS
15/0438, owned by the respondent No.1 and insured with the respondent No.3,
Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. The tribunal made an award of Rs.2,25,500/- which
included loss of dependency Rs.2,16,000, loss of estate Rs.2500, loss of consortium
Rs.5,000/- and funeral expense Rs.2,000/-. The tribunal also awarded interest @

6% from the date of filing of the claim petition. [3] | have heard Mr. BK Jain, learned counsel for the appellant and Mr. S

Dutta, learned Sr. [4] Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the tribunal failed to
make a just and reasonable award and urged for enhancement of award towards
loss of dependency, consortium, funeral expense and loss of estate. Mr. Dutta, learned senior counsel fairly contended, that
on principle claimants deserve some enhancement as the tribunal did not follow the

principle laid down by the Apex Court while granting award on certain heads. Learned counsel further contended that tribunal ought to have taken a
liberal view keeping in mind the beneficial object of the legislation while deciding the
income of the deceased, who was working in an unorganized sector. However, Circle Officer was not examined and therefore, learned tribunal declined to
rely on the income certificate issued by the Circle Officer. Although the claimant
deposed that source of income of the deceased was fishery business, it was
mentioned in income certificate produced by the claimant, that the income was from
agriculture. What transpires from the
materials on record is that, the tribunal while assuming notional income, failed to
notice certain relevant factors, which could throw light on the income of the
deceased. Because, a person working in an unorganized sector, may not be able to
produce an income certificate. Even if the income certificate is disbelieved,
considering the fact that the deceased was a young man, and he was maintaining a
family of 5-6 persons, his income at the relevant time could not be less than
Rs.4,000/-. In that view of the matter, learned tribunal ought not to have taken the
notional income of Rs.18,000/- in the present case, which is usually permissible in

case of non earning member. [6] So far the age of the deceased and multiplier applied by the tribunal, there
IS nO dispute. The age of the deceased being 34 years following the decision of the
Apex Court in Santosh Devi v. National Insurance Co. Ltd., (2012) 6 SCC
421, the claimants shall also be entitled to addition of 50% of the income as future
prospect to the real income. Thus, taking the income of the deceased as Rs.4,000/pm, adding 50% of the income as future prospect, monthly income with future
prospect would come to Rs.6,000/-. Considering the number of dependants, learned
tribunal rightly deducted 1/4"" of the income for personal expense of the deceased. Therefore, total loss of dependency in the
present case will be 4500 x 12 x 16 = 8,64,000/
[7] Learned counsel relying on the decision of the Apex Court in Rajesh Vs. Since the tribunal has awarded only a meager amount of Rs.5,000/-, |
am of the view, that the claimant deserves an enhancement towards consortium and
accordingly, following the principle of Rajesh v. Rajbir Singh, (2013) 9 SCC 54,
consortium is required to be enhanced to Rs.1,00,000/-. Kishore Dhan & others reported in (2013) 7 SCC 476,
Vanalapekhulai & Ors Vs. Shivnath Singh & others reported in 2015 2 GL/
459 contended that adequate compensation should be granted on account of love
and affection of the minor children. In the present case, the deceased has left
minor children and therefore, | am of the view, that the claimant is certainly entitled
to some amount for love, affection and care of the minor children. All those
decisions cited by the learned counsel shows that various amount have been granted

on the basis of peculiar facts of each case. However, following the latest decision of

MAC App No.126/2011
the Apex Court in Bhogi Redsdy Varalakshmi and Ors Vs. The medical evidence adduced by the claimant shows, that the deceased survived
for 20 months after the accident. The documentary evidence Exhibit-1 to Exhibit-23
and Exhibit-26 demonstrate, that the deceased was hospitalized twice, once in GMCH
and once in Dispur Poly Clinic. The medical documents also show that the deceased
had undergone treatment at Christian Medical College. From the medical documents
as well as oral evidence of the doctor, CW-3, it appears that the deceased sustained
multiple fracture involving Rt 10"" to 12"" Ribs, left transverse process of L1 to L4
vertebra and Rt. The deceased has also
developed quadriplegia due to injuries of spinal cord. No doubt, the claimant being a rural uneducated lady, could not
preserve the documents relating to expense incurred for treatment of the deceased
for 20 months. That does not mean, that claimant did not incur any expense for
treatment. Considering
the gravity of the injuries and length of treatment, it may not be difficult to
understand for any prudent person, that claimant incurred a considerable amount for
treatment of the deceased. But the tribunal is found to have totally ignored this

aspect of the matter. ndia |nsurance Company Ltd reported in

compensation was awarded by the Tribunal which was enhanced to
7.5% by the High Court. [13] In view of the above decision of the Apex Court, | am of the view that the

JUDGMENT & ORDER (CAV)

Unsatisfied with the award made by the MACT, Barpeta, in MAC Case
No.764/2005, the claimant, wife of the deceased, has filed this appeal for

enhancement of the award.

[2] Undisputed facts relevant for disposal of this appeal are that the husband
of the claimant Raizuddin died in a motor vehicle accident involving vehicle No.AS
15/0438, owned by the respondent No.1 and insured with the respondent No.3,
Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. The tribunal made an award of Rs.2,25,500/- which
included loss of dependency Rs.2,16,000, loss of estate Rs.2500, loss of consortium
Rs.5,000/- and funeral expense Rs.2,000/-. The tribunal also awarded interest @

6% from the date of filing of the claim petition.

[3] | have heard Mr. BK Jain, learned counsel for the appellant and Mr. S

Dutta, learned Sr. counsel for the Insurance Company.

[4] Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the tribunal failed to
make a just and reasonable award and urged for enhancement of award towards
loss of dependency, consortium, funeral expense and loss of estate. Further
contention of the learned counsel was that tribunal failed to award any amount
towards love and affection of the children and urged to enhance the award to make
it just and reasonable one. Mr. Dutta, learned senior counsel fairly contended, that
on principle claimants deserve some enhancement as the tribunal did not follow the

principle laid down by the Apex Court while granting award on certain heads.

MAC App No.126/2011
[5] Mr. BK Jain, submitted that claimant has adduced sufficient evidence to
show that deceased was earning Rs.5000 per month from his fishery business, but
learned tribunal took notional income of Rs.1500/- per month, ignoring the materials
on record. Learned counsel further contended that tribunal ought to have taken a
liberal view keeping in mind the beneficial object of the legislation while deciding the
income of the deceased, who was working in an unorganized sector. The claimant
examining herself as Pw-1 deposed that her husband, the deceased was earning
Rs.60,000/- per year, from his business of fishery. The claimant also produced a
certificate issued by the Circle Officer, in support of income of the deceased.
However, Circle Officer was not examined and therefore, learned tribunal declined to
rely on the income certificate issued by the Circle Officer. Although the claimant
deposed that source of income of the deceased was fishery business, it was
mentioned in income certificate produced by the claimant, that the income was from
agriculture. Perhaps, because of such discrepancy, learned tribunal disbelieved the
income certificate and took a lumpsum notional income. What transpires from the
materials on record is that, the tribunal while assuming notional income, failed to
notice certain relevant factors, which could throw light on the income of the
deceased. Because, a person working in an unorganized sector, may not be able to
produce an income certificate. Evidently the deceased was a young man of 34 years
of age and maintaining a family of 5 dependants, therefore obviously he had some
earning from whatever sources it may be. In view of the above facts, assumption of
notional income of Rs.18,000/- by the tribunal does not appears to be in conformity
with the materials on record. Off course, from the certificate produced by the
claimant, it appears that it was a ‘ready to use’ document and hardly worthy of
placing reliance. Since it is difficult to have the accurate income of a person working
In an unorganized sector, Keeping in view the beneficial object of the legislation, it is
permissible to have some guess work while considering the income of rural people
working in an unorganized sector. Even if the income certificate is disbelieved,
considering the fact that the deceased was a young man, and he was maintaining a
family of 5-6 persons, his income at the relevant time could not be less than
Rs.4,000/-. In that view of the matter, learned tribunal ought not to have taken the
notional income of Rs.18,000/- in the present case, which is usually permissible in

case of non earning member. Being of the above view, | am of the opinion that the

MAC App No.126/2011
income of the deceased could not be assumed less than Rs.4,000/- in the facts and

circumstance of the present case.

[6] So far the age of the deceased and multiplier applied by the tribunal, there
IS nO dispute. The age of the deceased being 34 years following the decision of the
Apex Court in Santosh Devi v. National Insurance Co. Ltd., (2012) 6 SCC
421, the claimants shall also be entitled to addition of 50% of the income as future
prospect to the real income. Thus, taking the income of the deceased as Rs.4,000/pm, adding 50% of the income as future prospect, monthly income with future
prospect would come to Rs.6,000/-. Considering the number of dependants, learned
tribunal rightly deducted 1/4"" of the income for personal expense of the deceased.
If 1/4 of the income is deducted, the monthly loss of dependency comes to
Rs.4,000/- + Rs.2,000/- - % = Rs.4500/-. Therefore, total loss of dependency in the
present case will be 4500 x 12 x 16 = 8,64,000/
[7] Learned counsel relying on the decision of the Apex Court in Rajesh Vs.
Rajbir Singh contended that tribunal ought to have granted at least Rs.1,00,000 for
consortium. Since the tribunal has awarded only a meager amount of Rs.5,000/-, |
am of the view, that the claimant deserves an enhancement towards consortium and
accordingly, following the principle of Rajesh v. Rajbir Singh, (2013) 9 SCC 54,
consortium is required to be enhanced to Rs.1,00,000/-. Since no specific evidence
has been adduced with regard to funeral expense, claimants would certainly be
entitled to at least the minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- towards funeral expense as

per the principle laid down in Rajesh Vs. Rajbir (Supra).

[8] The learned counsel for the appellant relying on the decision of High Court
in /iju Kuruvila v. Kunfufamma Mohan reported in (2013) 9 SCC 166, Vimal
Kanwar Vs. Kishore Dhan & others reported in (2013) 7 SCC 476,
Vanalapekhulai & Ors Vs. Shivnath Singh & others reported in 2015 2 GL/
459 contended that adequate compensation should be granted on account of love
and affection of the minor children. In the present case, the deceased has left
minor children and therefore, | am of the view, that the claimant is certainly entitled
to some amount for love, affection and care of the minor children. All those
decisions cited by the learned counsel shows that various amount have been granted

on the basis of peculiar facts of each case. However, following the latest decision of

MAC App No.126/2011
the Apex Court in Bhogi Redsdy Varalakshmi and Ors Vs. Mani
Muthupandi & Anr, reported in (2017) 2 TAC 3 SCC, | am of the view, that the
amount of Rs.1,00,000/- in the facts and circumstance of the present case would be
just and reasonable compensation towards love, affection and care of the children

altogether.

[9] The learned counsel for the appellant has contended that the
deceased survived for 20 months after the accident and he was under
continuous treatment, for which the claimant incurred a huge amount, but the
tribunal did not grant any amount for treatment of the deceased.
The medical evidence adduced by the claimant shows, that the deceased survived
for 20 months after the accident. The documentary evidence Exhibit-1 to Exhibit-23
and Exhibit-26 demonstrate, that the deceased was hospitalized twice, once in GMCH
and once in Dispur Poly Clinic. The medical documents also show that the deceased
had undergone treatment at Christian Medical College. From the medical documents
as well as oral evidence of the doctor, CW-3, it appears that the deceased sustained
multiple fracture involving Rt 10"" to 12"" Ribs, left transverse process of L1 to L4
vertebra and Rt. Ala of sacrum and Bileteral plural effusion. The deceased has also
developed quadriplegia due to injuries of spinal cord. He also suffered from bed sore
due to paralysis. No doubt, the claimant being a rural uneducated lady, could not
preserve the documents relating to expense incurred for treatment of the deceased
for 20 months. That does not mean, that claimant did not incur any expense for
treatment. While dealing with the question of determining just compensation,
tribunal is not supposed to act as a referee and must be alive to the attending facts
and circumstance having bearing on determination of just compensation. Considering
the gravity of the injuries and length of treatment, it may not be difficult to
understand for any prudent person, that claimant incurred a considerable amount for
treatment of the deceased. But the tribunal is found to have totally ignored this

aspect of the matter.

[10] Notwithstanding failure of the claimant to produce document to show the
actual expenditure for medical treatment of the deceased, the evidence adduced by
the claimant showing gravity of the injury and length of treatment was sufficient for

awarding some amount towards medical expenses and therefore, | am of the view

MAC App No.126/2011
that at least an amount of Rs.25,000/- should be awarded for medical expense of the

deceased.

[11] Placing reliance on the decision of Vima/l Konwar Vs. Kishore Dhan
(supra), Syed Sadique Vs. United !ndia |nsurance Company Ltd reported in
(2014) 2 SCC, V Maleka Vs. M Malathi & Anr reported in (2014) 11 SCC 178
Mr. J ain submitted that at least an amount of Rs.25,000/- should have been awarded
for cost of litigation. Following the mandate of the Apex Court in the decisions cited
by the learned counsel and the facts and circumstance of the present case, | am of
the view that the claimant shall be entitled to some amount towards cost of

litigation.

[12] Learned counsel for the claimant has prayed for enhancement of the rate
of interest placing reliance on various decisions of the Apex Court including
Narendra Singh Vs. Nishant Sharma & Others reported in (2015) 14 SCC
353. Without burdening the judgment by quoting all the decisions, | feel that
reproducing the observation of the Apex Court in Narendra Singh (supra) would
suffice. The Apex Court held as under:

15. Further, an interest at the rate of 6% per annum on the
compensation was awarded by the Tribunal which was enhanced to
7.5% by the High Court. The interest rates determined by both the
Courts below are bad in law as per the legal principles laid down in
MCD V. Upahaar Tragedy Victims Assn, wherein this Court has awarded
interest at the rate of 9% per annum on the compensation awarded in
favour of the appellants. Applying the same legal principles, we grant
at the rate of 9% per annum on the compensation awarded by this
Court. Following the said principle interest is enhanced to 9%.

[13] In view of the above decision of the Apex Court, | am of the view that the
Interest granted by the learned tribunal @ 6% appears to be on lower side and the
claimant deserves little enhancement. Thus, following the decision of the Apex Court
In Narendra Singh (Supra), the interest is enhanced to 9% per annum from the date

of filing of the claim petition.

[14] Thus, taking into account the foregoing discussions, the enhanced

compensation to which the claimant will be entitled to is assessed as under:

MAC App No.126/2011
Loss of dependency: = 8,64,000
Loss of consortium = 1,00,000
Funeral Expense = 25,000
Loss of love and affection = 1,00,000
Loss of estate = 25,000
Cost of litigation = 10,000
Medical Expense = 25,000
= 11,49,000
[15] The respondent, Oriental Insurance Co. shall satisfy the award with 9%

interest from the date of filing of the claim petition, within two months from the date

of this judgment.
[16] The appeal is allowed with the enhancement of award as indicated above.

[17] Send back the LCR.

[2] Undisputed facts relevant for disposal of this appeal are that the husband
of the claimant Raizuddin died in a motor vehicle accident involving vehicle No.AS
15/0438, owned by the respondent No.1 and insured with the respondent No.3,
Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. The tribunal made an award of Rs.2,25,500/- which
included loss of dependency Rs.2,16,000, loss of estate Rs.2500, loss of consortium
Rs.5,000/- and funeral expense Rs.2,000/-. The tribunal also awarded interest @

6% from the date of filing of the claim petition.

[3] | have heard Mr. BK Jain, learned counsel for the appellant and Mr. S

Dutta, learned Sr. counsel for the Insurance Company.

[4] Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the tribunal failed to
make a just and reasonable award and urged for enhancement of award towards
loss of dependency, consortium, funeral expense and loss of estate. Further
contention of the learned counsel was that tribunal failed to award any amount
towards love and affection of the children and urged to enhance the award to make
it just and reasonable one. Mr. Dutta, learned senior counsel fairly contended, that
on principle claimants deserve some enhancement as the tribunal did not follow the

principle laid down by the Apex Court while granting award on certain heads.

MAC App No.126/2011
[5] Mr. BK Jain, submitted that claimant has adduced sufficient evidence to
show that deceased was earning Rs.5000 per month from his fishery business, but
learned tribunal took notional income of Rs.1500/- per month, ignoring the materials
on record. Learned counsel further contended that tribunal ought to have taken a
liberal view keeping in mind the beneficial object of the legislation while deciding the
income of the deceased, who was working in an unorganized sector. The claimant
examining herself as Pw-1 deposed that her husband, the deceased was earning
Rs.60,000/- per year, from his business of fishery. The claimant also produced a
certificate issued by the Circle Officer, in support of income of the deceased.
However, Circle Officer was not examined and therefore, learned tribunal declined to
rely on the income certificate issued by the Circle Officer. Although the claimant
deposed that source of income of the deceased was fishery business, it was
mentioned in income certificate produced by the claimant, that the income was from
agriculture. Perhaps, because of such discrepancy, learned tribunal disbelieved the
income certificate and took a lumpsum notional income. What transpires from the
materials on record is that, the tribunal while assuming notional income, failed to
notice certain relevant factors, which could throw light on the income of the
deceased. Because, a person working in an unorganized sector, may not be able to
produce an income certificate. Evidently the deceased was a young man of 34 years
of age and maintaining a family of 5 dependants, therefore obviously he had some
earning from whatever sources it may be. In view of the above facts, assumption of
notional income of Rs.18,000/- by the tribunal does not appears to be in conformity
with the materials on record. Off course, from the certificate produced by the
claimant, it appears that it was a ‘ready to use’ document and hardly worthy of
placing reliance. Since it is difficult to have the accurate income of a person working
In an unorganized sector, Keeping in view the beneficial object of the legislation, it is
permissible to have some guess work while considering the income of rural people
working in an unorganized sector. Even if the income certificate is disbelieved,
considering the fact that the deceased was a young man, and he was maintaining a
family of 5-6 persons, his income at the relevant time could not be less than
Rs.4,000/-. In that view of the matter, learned tribunal ought not to have taken the
notional income of Rs.18,000/- in the present case, which is usually permissible in

case of non earning member. Being of the above view, | am of the opinion that the

MAC App No.126/2011
income of the deceased could not be assumed less than Rs.4,000/- in the facts and

circumstance of the present case.

[6] So far the age of the deceased and multiplier applied by the tribunal, there
IS nO dispute. The age of the deceased being 34 years following the decision of the
Apex Court in Santosh Devi v. National Insurance Co. Ltd., (2012) 6 SCC
421, the claimants shall also be entitled to addition of 50% of the income as future
prospect to the real income. Thus, taking the income of the deceased as Rs.4,000/pm, adding 50% of the income as future prospect, monthly income with future
prospect would come to Rs.6,000/-. Considering the number of dependants, learned
tribunal rightly deducted 1/4"" of the income for personal expense of the deceased.
If 1/4 of the income is deducted, the monthly loss of dependency comes to
Rs.4,000/- + Rs.2,000/- - % = Rs.4500/-. Therefore, total loss of dependency in the
present case will be 4500 x 12 x 16 = 8,64,000/
[7] Learned counsel relying on the decision of the Apex Court in Rajesh Vs.
Rajbir Singh contended that tribunal ought to have granted at least Rs.1,00,000 for
consortium. Since the tribunal has awarded only a meager amount of Rs.5,000/-, |
am of the view, that the claimant deserves an enhancement towards consortium and
accordingly, following the principle of Rajesh v. Rajbir Singh, (2013) 9 SCC 54,
consortium is required to be enhanced to Rs.1,00,000/-. Since no specific evidence
has been adduced with regard to funeral expense, claimants would certainly be
entitled to at least the minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- towards funeral expense as

per the principle laid down in Rajesh Vs. Rajbir (Supra).

[8] The learned counsel for the appellant relying on the decision of High Court
in /iju Kuruvila v. Kunfufamma Mohan reported in (2013) 9 SCC 166, Vimal
Kanwar Vs. Kishore Dhan & others reported in (2013) 7 SCC 476,
Vanalapekhulai & Ors Vs. Shivnath Singh & others reported in 2015 2 GL/
459 contended that adequate compensation should be granted on account of love
and affection of the minor children. In the present case, the deceased has left
minor children and therefore, | am of the view, that the claimant is certainly entitled
to some amount for love, affection and care of the minor children. All those
decisions cited by the learned counsel shows that various amount have been granted

on the basis of peculiar facts of each case. However, following the latest decision of

MAC App No.126/2011
the Apex Court in Bhogi Redsdy Varalakshmi and Ors Vs. Mani
Muthupandi & Anr, reported in (2017) 2 TAC 3 SCC, | am of the view, that the
amount of Rs.1,00,000/- in the facts and circumstance of the present case would be
just and reasonable compensation towards love, affection and care of the children

altogether.

[9] The learned counsel for the appellant has contended that the
deceased survived for 20 months after the accident and he was under
continuous treatment, for which the claimant incurred a huge amount, but the
tribunal did not grant any amount for treatment of the deceased.
The medical evidence adduced by the claimant shows, that the deceased survived
for 20 months after the accident. The documentary evidence Exhibit-1 to Exhibit-23
and Exhibit-26 demonstrate, that the deceased was hospitalized twice, once in GMCH
and once in Dispur Poly Clinic. The medical documents also show that the deceased
had undergone treatment at Christian Medical College. From the medical documents
as well as oral evidence of the doctor, CW-3, it appears that the deceased sustained
multiple fracture involving Rt 10"" to 12"" Ribs, left transverse process of L1 to L4
vertebra and Rt. Ala of sacrum and Bileteral plural effusion. The deceased has also
developed quadriplegia due to injuries of spinal cord. He also suffered from bed sore
due to paralysis. No doubt, the claimant being a rural uneducated lady, could not
preserve the documents relating to expense incurred for treatment of the deceased
for 20 months. That does not mean, that claimant did not incur any expense for
treatment. While dealing with the question of determining just compensation,
tribunal is not supposed to act as a referee and must be alive to the attending facts
and circumstance having bearing on determination of just compensation. Considering
the gravity of the injuries and length of treatment, it may not be difficult to
understand for any prudent person, that claimant incurred a considerable amount for
treatment of the deceased. But the tribunal is found to have totally ignored this

aspect of the matter.

[10] Notwithstanding failure of the claimant to produce document to show the
actual expenditure for medical treatment of the deceased, the evidence adduced by
the claimant showing gravity of the injury and length of treatment was sufficient for

awarding some amount towards medical expenses and therefore, | am of the view

MAC App No.126/2011
that at least an amount of Rs.25,000/- should be awarded for medical expense of the

deceased.

[11] Placing reliance on the decision of Vima/l Konwar Vs. Kishore Dhan
(supra), Syed Sadique Vs. United !ndia |nsurance Company Ltd reported in
(2014) 2 SCC, V Maleka Vs. M Malathi & Anr reported in (2014) 11 SCC 178
Mr. J ain submitted that at least an amount of Rs.25,000/- should have been awarded
for cost of litigation. Following the mandate of the Apex Court in the decisions cited
by the learned counsel and the facts and circumstance of the present case, | am of
the view that the claimant shall be entitled to some amount towards cost of

litigation.

[12] Learned counsel for the claimant has prayed for enhancement of the rate
of interest placing reliance on various decisions of the Apex Court including
Narendra Singh Vs. Nishant Sharma & Others reported in (2015) 14 SCC
353. Without burdening the judgment by quoting all the decisions, | feel that
reproducing the observation of the Apex Court in Narendra Singh (supra) would
suffice. The Apex Court held as under:

15. Further, an interest at the rate of 6% per annum on the
compensation was awarded by the Tribunal which was enhanced to
7.5% by the High Court. The interest rates determined by both the
Courts below are bad in law as per the legal principles laid down in
MCD V. Upahaar Tragedy Victims Assn, wherein this Court has awarded
interest at the rate of 9% per annum on the compensation awarded in
favour of the appellants. Applying the same legal principles, we grant
at the rate of 9% per annum on the compensation awarded by this
Court. Following the said principle interest is enhanced to 9%.

[13] In view of the above decision of the Apex Court, | am of the view that the
Interest granted by the learned tribunal @ 6% appears to be on lower side and the
claimant deserves little enhancement. Thus, following the decision of the Apex Court
In Narendra Singh (Supra), the interest is enhanced to 9% per annum from the date

of filing of the claim petition.

[14] Thus, taking into account the foregoing discussions, the enhanced

compensation to which the claimant will be entitled to is assessed as under:

MAC App No.126/2011
Loss of dependency: = 8,64,000
Loss of consortium = 1,00,000
Funeral Expense = 25,000
Loss of love and affection = 1,00,000
Loss of estate = 25,000
Cost of litigation = 10,000
Medical Expense = 25,000
= 11,49,000
[15] The respondent, Oriental Insurance Co. shall satisfy the award with 9%

interest from the date of filing of the claim petition, within two months from the date

of this judgment.
[16] The appeal is allowed with the enhancement of award as indicated above.

[17] Send back the LCR.

JUDGMENT & ORDER (CAV)

Unsatisfied with the award made by the MACT, Barpeta, in MAC Case
No.764/2005, the claimant, wife of the deceased, has filed this appeal for

enhancement of the award.

[2] Undisputed facts relevant for disposal of this appeal are that the husband
of the claimant Raizuddin died in a motor vehicle accident involving vehicle No.AS
15/0438, owned by the respondent No.1 and insured with the respondent No.3,
Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. The tribunal made an award of Rs.2,25,500/- which
included loss of dependency Rs.2,16,000, loss of estate Rs.2500, loss of consortium
Rs.5,000/- and funeral expense Rs.2,000/-. The tribunal also awarded interest @

6% from the date of filing of the claim petition.

[3] | have heard Mr. BK Jain, learned counsel for the appellant and Mr. S

Dutta, learned Sr. counsel for the Insurance Company.

[4] Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the tribunal failed to
make a just and reasonable award and urged for enhancement of award towards
loss of dependency, consortium, funeral expense and loss of estate. Further
contention of the learned counsel was that tribunal failed to award any amount
towards love and affection of the children and urged to enhance the award to make
it just and reasonable one. Mr. Dutta, learned senior counsel fairly contended, that
on principle claimants deserve some enhancement as the tribunal did not follow the

principle laid down by the Apex Court while granting award on certain heads.

MAC App No.126/2011
[5] Mr. BK Jain, submitted that claimant has adduced sufficient evidence to
show that deceased was earning Rs.5000 per month from his fishery business, but
learned tribunal took notional income of Rs.1500/- per month, ignoring the materials

considering the fact that the deceased was a young man, and he was maintaining a

Rs.4,000/-. In that view of the matter, learned tribunal ought not to have taken the
notional income of Rs.18,000/- in the present case, which is usually permissible in

MAC App No.126/2011
income of the deceased could not be assumed less than Rs.4,000/- in the facts and

circumstance of the present case.

[6] So far the age of the deceased and multiplier applied by the tribunal, there
IS nO dispute. The age of the deceased being 34 years following the decision of the
Apex Court in Santosh Devi v. National Insurance Co. Ltd., (2012) 6 SCC

prospect would come to Rs.6,000/-. Considering the number of dependants, learned
tribunal rightly deducted 1/4"" of the income for personal expense of the deceased.
If 1/4 of the income is deducted, the monthly loss of dependency comes to
Rs.4,000/- + Rs.2,000/- - % = Rs.4500/-. Therefore, total loss of dependency in the
present case will be 4500 x 12 x 16 = 8,64,000/
[7] Learned counsel relying on the decision of the Apex Court in Rajesh Vs.
Rajbir Singh contended that tribunal ought to have granted at least Rs.1,00,000 for
consortium. Since the tribunal has awarded only a meager amount of Rs.5,000/-, |
am of the view, that the claimant deserves an enhancement towards consortium and
accordingly, following the principle of Rajesh v. Rajbir Singh, (2013) 9 SCC 54,
consortium is required to be enhanced to Rs.1,00,000/-. Since no specific evidence
has been adduced with regard to funeral expense, claimants would certainly be
entitled to at least the minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- towards funeral expense as

per the principle laid down in Rajesh Vs. Rajbir (Supra).

[8] The learned counsel for the appellant relying on the decision of High Court
in /iju Kuruvila v. Kunfufamma Mohan reported in (2013) 9 SCC 166, Vimal
Kanwar Vs. Kishore Dhan & others reported in (2013) 7 SCC 476,
Vanalapekhulai & Ors Vs. Shivnath Singh & others reported in 2015 2 GL/
459 contended that adequate compensation should be granted on account of love
and affection of the minor children. In the present case, the deceased has left
minor children and therefore, | am of the view, that the claimant is certainly entitled
to some amount for love, affection and care of the minor children. All those
decisions cited by the learned counsel shows that various amount have been granted

on the basis of peculiar facts of each case. However, following the latest decision of

amount of Rs.1,00,000/- in the facts and circumstance of the present case would be

altogether.

(2014) 2 SCC, V Maleka Vs. M Malathi & Anr reported in (2014) 11 SCC 178

In Narendra Singh (Supra), the interest is enhanced to 9% per annum from the date

For the Appellants: Mr. Sisir Dutta, Sr. Advocate
Mr. R. Goswami, Advocate

For the Respondents: Mr. SUrajit Dutta, Advocate
BEFORE
THE HON’BLE MR. Brief facts, which led to the present appeals are that on 31.03.2010,
Late Dipankar Kakati was travelling in a car bearing registration No. The car was driven by Late Dipankar Kakati,
who was the owner of the vehicle. The said car driven by deceased Dipankar
Kakati met with an accident after hitting against a standing truck, which was
parked on the middle of road without any parking light or indicator. The
learned Tribunal apportioned the liability attributing contributory negligence
to the deceased to the extent of 40%. Aggrieved by the judgment and award, both the Insurance Companies

have preferred the respective appeals. The Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd., appellant in MAC Appl. (i) The deceased was owner of the car and the accident having taken
place for negligence of the deceased himself, the insurer of the car
was not liable to pay any compensation, as under the policy, liability
of the Insurance Company was to indemnify the insured in respect of
claim of third party only. Delhi Transport Corp. reported in (2009) 6 SCC 121;

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 2 of 18
ought to have been 1/2 of the income, as the claim petition was filed

by mother, for death of her son. 272/2014 raised the following points:

(i) While assessing loss of dependency, learned Tribunal did not
deduct the professional tax and income tax from the gross
income of the deceased. Further contention of the learned
counsel was that the New India Assurance Co. having not obtained leave
under Section 170 MV Act is also not entitled to challenge the quantum of
award in appeal. Mr. Surajit Dutta
also contended that although in a subsequent decision of United /ndta
/nsurance Co. Ltd. Vs. The Apex Court in Mico//etta Rahtog/ (supra) dealing with the right
of the insurance company to prefer appeal on merit of the claim and quantum

of compensation observed as under:

‘For the aforesaid reasons, an insurer If aggrieved against an
award, may file an appeal only on those grounds and no other. Thus where conaitions precedent embodied in Section 170 Is

MAC App. Sections 149, 170 and 173 are part of one Scheme and if we
give any different interpretation to Section 173 of the 1988
Act, the same would go contrary to the scheme and object of
the Act.” As per Shila Datta (supra) case, once the insurance company Is
made party respondent, irrespective of the fact, whether it is made party by
the claimant or by the Tribunal under Section 170 MV Act, it can raise all
grounds including the grounds, which are available to the insured. Mr. Surajit Dutta placing reliance on the decision of the Apex Court in
Sundip Kumar Batna Vs. State of Maharashtra reported in (2014) 16
SCC 623 submitted that when the co-equal Benches of equal strength of

judges of the Apex court are divergence of views, the view taken in the

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 5 of 18
former decision is binding and not the decision rendered subsequently by coequal Bench. Mr. Surajit Dutta, in support of his submission placed reliance

on paragraph - 17 of the judgment, which is reproduced below:

“17. The Constitution Bench in Union of India vs Raghubir
Singh, 1989 (2) SCC 754, has come to the condusion
extracted below:

‘27. What then should be the position in regard to the effect
of the law pronounced by a Division Bench in relation to a case
raising the same point subsequently before a Division Bench of
a smaller number of Judges? There is no constitutional or
statutory prescription in the matter, and the point is governed
entirely by the practice in India of the courts sanctified by
reoeated affirmation over a century of time. /t cannot be
doubted that in order to promote consistency and certainty in
the law laid down by a superior Court, the ideal conoaition
would be that the entire Court should sit in all cases to decide
questions of law, and for that reason the Supreme Court of the
United States does so. But having regard to the volurne of
work demanding the attention of the Court, it has been found
necessary in India as a general rule of practice and
convenience that the Court should sit in Divisions, each
Division being constituted of /udges whose number may be
determined by the exigencies of judicdal need, by the nature of
the case including any statutory mandate relative thereto, and
by such other considerations which the Chief /ustice, in whom
such authority devolves by convention, may find most
aooroonate. This prinaple has been
followed in Inala by several generations of / udges. ...” In support of the submission,

learned counsel placed reliance on a Division Bench judgment of this Court in

MAC App. State of Punjab, (2014) 6 SCC 514 has held that in case of
contlict of co-ordinate Benches of equal strength, the latter
decision has to be followed spedally when earlier decision
rendered by co-ordinate Bench has been explained. Similar
view has been taken by a five-/udge Bench of the Madhya
Pradesh High Court in Jabalour Bus Operators Vs. A Full bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court in /aba/pur Bus
Operators Vs. There are High Courts which hold that decision
of earlier Bench Is binding because of the theory of binding
precedent and Article 141 of the Constitution of Inala. Deasions which are
rendered without considering the decisions expressing contrary
view have no value as a precedent. But in our considered
opinion, the position may be stated thus
With regard to the High Court, a Single Bench Is bound

by the decision of another Single Bench. In case, he
does not agree with the view of the other Single Bench,

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 7 of 18
he should refer the matter to the Larger Bench. Similarly, Division Bench Is bound by the judgment of
earlier Division Bench. In case, it does not agree with
the view of the earlier Division Bench, it should refer
the matter to Larger Bench. ! /n case of conflict between two decisions of the Aoex Court,
Benches comprising of egual number of /udges, decision of
earlier Bench is binding unless explained by the latter Bench of
equal strength, in which case the later decision Is binding. Therefore, the decision of earlier Division Bench, unless
distinguished by latter Division Bench, Is binding on the High
Courts and the Subordinate Courts. High Courts and Subordinate Courts should lack cormpetence to
Interoret decisions of Aoex Court since that would not only
defeat what Is envisaged under Article 141 of the Constitution
of Inala but also militate hierarchical suyoremacy of Courts. 272/2014 Page 8 of 18
not lay down the correct law as to application of precedent
and Is, therefore, over-ruled on this point.” In view of the above situation, when the Apex Court in SA//a Datta
(Supra) explained the earlier decision in NMicco/letta Rohtag/ (supra) and
decided the question as indicated above in favour of the insurer, | am of the
view, that in view of the decision of the Division Bench of this Court and also
the principle laid down by the Full Bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court, the
decision rendered by three judges Bench of Apex Court in Shi/la Datta
(Supra) subsequently, is binding on this Court. Next point raised by Surajit Dutta was that the Bajaj Allianz General
Insurance Company is debarred from raising any defence on the basis of the
policy, in absence of evidence adduced by the Insurance Company inasmuch
as, the policy was not proved by the insurance company. To buttress the
submission, Mr. Dutta placed reliance on a decision of Patna High Court in
Sial Sinha Vs. It transpires from the record, that the policy under which the vehicle
of the deceased was insured has been proved as Ext.10 by the claimant
himself. Since the policy has been proved and brought on evidence, it is
Immaterial who has adduced such evidence and proved the policy. Since
there is evidence on record, both the parties can rely upon such evidence, as
law never preclude any party from relying on the evidence adduced by the
Opposite party. Therefore, there is no bar on the part of the Insurance
Company in replying upon such documentary evidence, though adduced by
the claimant. The insurance policy (Ext.10) transpires that it was a package

policy for private vehicle. Section 147 of the MV Act reads as under:

‘147 Requirements of policies and limits of liability. — For the removal of doubts, it is hereby
declared that the death of or bodily injury to any
person or damage to any property of a third party shall
be deemed to have been caused by or to have arisen
out of, the use of a vehicle in a public place
notwithstanding that the person who is dead or injured
or the property which is damaged was not in a public
place at the time of the accident, if the act or omission
which led to the accident occurred in a public place. 272/2014 Page 11 of 18
(3) A policy shall be of no effect for the purposes of this
Chapter unless and until there is issued by the insurer in
favour of the person by whom the policy is effected a
certificate of insurance in the prescribed form and containing
the prescribed particulars of any condition subject to which the
policy is issued and of any other prescribed matters; and
different forms, particulars and matters may be prescribed in
different cases. (5) Notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time
being in force, an insurer issuing a policy of insurance under
this section shall be liable to indemnify the person or classes of
persons specified in the policy in respect of any liability which
the policy purports to cover in the case of that person or those
classes of persons.” It is also settled position of
law, that there are two types of insurance policy, one Is statutory policy and
the other is contractual policy. Under statutory policy, liability of the
Insurance Company Is limited to what is laid down in Section 147 of the MV
Act. It is abundantly clear from the provision of Section 147 MV Act
and also Section 163-A or 140 MV Act that the liability to pay compensation

to the victim of motor vehicle accident is basically on the owner of the

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 12 of 18
vehicle, which the insurer is required to indemnify by virtue of the contract of
the policy. We have perused the judgment of this Court in the case of
Dhanraj Supra. ! The MACT held the ariver of the /eeo
responsible for the acadent. Furthermore, in the Cdaim petition
filed by the appellant, the MACT directed the driver and the
/nsurance Company to pay compensation to the appellant. The Insurance
Company was, in appeal before this Court challenging the
Judgment of the High Court awarding cornoensation to the
owner of the insured vehicle. Taking into consideration the
provision contained in Section 147 of the Act, this Court
observed as follows :
“8. Section 147
does not require an insurance company to assume risk
for death or bodily injury to the owner of the vehicle. an owner of the
vehicle has no lability to a third party the insurance
company has no lability also. In this case, it has not been shown that the policy
covered any risk for injury to the owner himself. It Is thus Clear that this premium
Is towards damage to the vehicle and not for injury to
the person of the owner. An owner of a vehicle can
only claim provided a personal acadent insurance has
been taken out. In view of the aforesaid ratio of law, the claim made by the
resoondents could not have been allowed. The imougned Award as
well as the imougned judgment of the High Court are set
aside.” The perusal of the policy (Ext.10) shows, that the deceased as owner
of his vehicle, paid an extra premium for personal accident coverage and
therefore, the liability of the insurer in the instant case for death or injury of
the owner, could not be beyond what Is provided in the policy as per contract
between the insurer and insured. Leaned counsel for both the Insurance Company submitted that while
calculating the loss of dependency, Tribunal deducted 1/3 of the income as
future prospect, whereas, as per the principle laid down in Sarla Verma
(Supra) such deduction for personal expenses ought to have been 1/2 of the
income. However, where the family of the

bachelor is large and dependent on the income of the deceased, the

MAC App. The claimant examined 4 witnesses, out of which, CW-2 was

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 15 of 18
the eye witness, who was travelling in the vehicle with the deceased. The
CW-2 categorically stated that the truck was parked in the middle of the road
without any parking light and for negligent parking of the truck in the middle
of the road, the accident occurred. Accident Information Report, Ext.1 as well
as the charge sheet, Ext. 3 shows that the accident occurred due to fault of
the driver of the truck. This part of the statement of CW-4 appears to be his opinion, whch does not
carry any evidentiary value. Apparently, CW-4 was not an eye witness and as
such he had no personal knowledge as to how the vehicle was driven or how
the accident occurred. But the categorical evidence of the eye witness, CW-2
that the truck was parked in the middle of the road without any back light,
because of which the accident occurred, supported by the documentary
evidence being the charge sheet, left no room for any speculation as to who

was at fault for the accident. However, considering the facts and circumstances of the case and the
totality of the evidence, learned Tribunal in its wisdom apportioned the
liability attributing same amount of contributory negligence to the deceased, |
do not find any fault with such finding of the Tribunal in apportioning the
liability fixing 40% contributory negligence on the deceased, inasmuch as, the
claimant or the insurer of the Santro car has not challenged the finding of the

Tribunal with regard to apportionment of the liability. The claimant has stated that salary of the deceased, who was a
Mechanical Engineer was Rs. 38,438/- and proved a salary certificate issued
by his employer as Ext.11. |n absence of such evidence, | am of the view that no deduction
towards income tax could be made. Another point raised by Mr. S. Dutta
referring to the cross examination of CW-1, that deceased used to send Rs. 7000/- was the only contribution to the family and
therefore loss of dependency ought to have been assessed on the basis of
the said contribution of Rs. | do not find any force in
this submission of the learned counsel, for the simple reason, that only
because the deceased used to send Rs. 7000/- per month by Money Order
that itself would not necessarily mean, that the deceased was not looking

after his parents or did not contribute to the family. In view of the forgoing discussions, | am of the view that the
compensation determined by the Tribunal in the instant case warrant no
interference. That apart, deceased not being third party, so far Bajaj Allianz | nsurance
Co. is concerned, the insurer of the deceased/owner is not liable to pay

compensation for the death of the owner/insured. 2/. With the above modification in the award with regard to liability of the
appellant Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd, the appeal filed by Bajaj
Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd is allowed and the appeal filed New India
Assurance Co. Ltd. is dismissed. 272/2014 Page 18 of 18

JUDGMENT & ORDER

These two appeals are filed by New India Assurance Co. Ltd. and
Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd., respectively, challenging the
judgment and award dated 12.07.2013 passed by MACT, Tinsukia in Mac
Case No. 29/2011.

MAC Appl. 272/2014 Page 1 of 18
2. Brief facts, which led to the present appeals are that on 31.03.2010,
Late Dipankar Kakati was travelling in a car bearing registration No. As-23/F1209 from Guwahati to Digboi. The car was driven by Late Dipankar Kakati,
who was the owner of the vehicle. The said car driven by deceased Dipankar
Kakati met with an accident after hitting against a standing truck, which was
parked on the middle of road without any parking light or indicator. As a
result of the accident, he sustained injuries and died. The parents of Late
Dipankar Kakati filed a claim petition before the MACT, Tinsukia, and the
learned Tribunal passed an award of Rs. 30,86,289/- with interest @ 6%. The
learned Tribunal apportioned the liability attributing contributory negligence
to the deceased to the extent of 40%. The vehicle owned and driven by
deceased was insured with the appellant Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co.
Ltd. and the truck involved in the accident was insured with New India
Assurance Co. Ltd.

3. Aggrieved by the judgment and award, both the Insurance Companies

have preferred the respective appeals.

4. The Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd., appellant in MAC Appl.
221/2015 raised the following points in its appeal No. 221/2015.

(i) The deceased was owner of the car and the accident having taken
place for negligence of the deceased himself, the insurer of the car
was not liable to pay any compensation, as under the policy, liability
of the Insurance Company was to indemnify the insured in respect of
claim of third party only. The deceased being owner and diver of the
vehicle, insured with Bajaj Alianz General Insurnce Co. Ltd., Tribunal
ought not to have held the insurer of the deceased, responsible for
satisfying 40% of the award.

(il) The Tribunal wrongly deducted 1/3 of the income towards personal
expenses, which as per the principle laid down in Sarala Verma
(Smt.) Vs. Delhi Transport Corp. reported in (2009) 6 SCC 121;

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 2 of 18
ought to have been 1/2 of the income, as the claim petition was filed

by mother, for death of her son.

5. The appellant in MAC Appl. 272/2014 raised the following points:

(i) While assessing loss of dependency, learned Tribunal did not
deduct the professional tax and income tax from the gross
income of the deceased.

(ii) Assessment of dependency was wrong.

(ili) © The accident occurred due to the fault of the deceased himself
and therefore, insurer of the standing truck ought not to have
been saddled with the liability to satisfy the award

(iv) | The claimant being parents, the Tribunal ought not to have

granted consortium.

6. Learned Sr. Counsel, Mr. S. Dutta for the New India Assurance Co.
Ltd., learned counsel Mr. R. Goswami for the Bajaj Allianz General Insurance
Co. Ltd. and learned counsel Mr. Surajit Dutta for the respondents were

heard at length.

7. Leaned counsel Mr. R. Goswami, contended that as per the policy, the
Insurer of the vehicle, owned by the deceased was not liable to pay any
compensation, as the deceased was not a third party. As per Section 147 of the
MV Act, liability of the Insurance Company is to indemnify the insured, for any
claim against the owner, in respect of death or injury of a third party. Learned
counsel also submitted that the Tribunal ought to have deducted 50% of the
Income while assessing the loss of dependency, considering the fact, that the
claim petition was by mother for the death of son and there was no other
dependents, but deduction of 1/3 in the instant case was improper as the
deceased left no other dependent except the parents and claim petition was filed

by his mother.

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 3 of 18
8. Mr. Surajit Dutta, learned counsel for the respondent/claimant
vehemently arguing on the locus of both the Insurance Co. to prefer appeal,
contended that the case was proceeded ex-parte against the Bajaj Allianz
General Insurance Company before the Tribunal and therefore, the said
company has no right to file appeal. Further contention of the learned
counsel was that the New India Assurance Co. having not obtained leave
under Section 170 MV Act is also not entitled to challenge the quantum of
award in appeal. In support of his submission, learned counsel placed
reliance on the decision of the Apex Court in National /[nsurance Co. Ltd.
Vs. Nicolletta Rohtagi, reported in (2002) 7 SCC 456. Mr. Surajit Dutta
also contended that although in a subsequent decision of United /ndta
/nsurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Shila Datta reported in (2011) 10 SCC 509, a
contrary view was taken by the Apex Court, the decision of Nico/letta

(Supra) being earlier in point of time is binding.

9. The Apex Court in Mico//etta Rahtog/ (supra) dealing with the right
of the insurance company to prefer appeal on merit of the claim and quantum

of compensation observed as under:

‘For the aforesaid reasons, an insurer If aggrieved against an
award, may file an appeal only on those grounds and no other.
However, by virtue of Section 170 of the 1988 Act, where in
course of an enguiry the Claims Tribunal Is satisfied that (a )
there Is a collusion between the person making a Claim and
the person against whom the Claim has been made or (b) the
person against whom the Caim has been made has failed to
contest the claim, the tribunal may, for reasons to be recorded
in writing, impolead the insurer and in that case it 1s permissible
for the insurer to contest the claim also on the grounds which
are available to the insured or to the person against whom the
Claim has been made. Thus, unless an order Is passed by the
tribunal permitting the insurer to avail the grounds available to
an insured or any other person against whom a Claim has been
made on being satisfied of the two conalitions soecitied in
Section 170 of the Act, it is not permissible to the insurer to
contest the daim on the grounds which are available to the
Insured or to a person against whom a claim has been made.
Thus where conaitions precedent embodied in Section 170 Is

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 4 of 18
satistied and award Is adverse to the interest of the insurer,
the insurer has a noht to file an appeal challenging the
guantum of compensation or negligence or contributory
negligence of the offending vehicle even if the insured has not
filed any appeal against the quantum of compensation.
Sections 149, 170 and 173 are part of one Scheme and if we
give any different interpretation to Section 173 of the 1988
Act, the same would go contrary to the scheme and object of
the Act.”

10. A three Judges Bench of the Apex Court in Shi/a Datta (supra)
answering the question whether insurer can contest a motor accident claim
on merit in regard to the quantum in addition to the ground mentioned in
Section 149(2) of the Act for avoiding liability under the policy of insurance
held as under:

‘Therefore, where the insurer is a party- respondent, either on
account of being impleaded as a party by the tribunal under
section 170 or being impleaded as a party-respondent by the
claimants in the claim petition voluntarily, it will be entitled to
contest the matter by raising all grounds, without being
restricted to the grounds available under section 149(2) of the
Act. The claim petition is maintainable against the owner and
driver without impleading the insurer as a party”

11. As per Shila Datta (supra) case, once the insurance company Is
made party respondent, irrespective of the fact, whether it is made party by
the claimant or by the Tribunal under Section 170 MV Act, it can raise all
grounds including the grounds, which are available to the insured. What
therefore follows from S/A//a Datta (supra) is that, when the insurance
company is made party even by the claimant, it can contest the claim raising
all defence available to insured and the question of obtaining leave as

contemplated in Section 170 MV Act becomes redundtant.

12. Mr. Surajit Dutta placing reliance on the decision of the Apex Court in
Sundip Kumar Batna Vs. State of Maharashtra reported in (2014) 16
SCC 623 submitted that when the co-equal Benches of equal strength of

judges of the Apex court are divergence of views, the view taken in the

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 5 of 18
former decision is binding and not the decision rendered subsequently by coequal Bench. Mr. Surajit Dutta, in support of his submission placed reliance

on paragraph - 17 of the judgment, which is reproduced below:

“17. The Constitution Bench in Union of India vs Raghubir
Singh, 1989 (2) SCC 754, has come to the condusion
extracted below:

‘27. What then should be the position in regard to the effect
of the law pronounced by a Division Bench in relation to a case
raising the same point subsequently before a Division Bench of
a smaller number of Judges? There is no constitutional or
statutory prescription in the matter, and the point is governed
entirely by the practice in India of the courts sanctified by
reoeated affirmation over a century of time. /t cannot be
doubted that in order to promote consistency and certainty in
the law laid down by a superior Court, the ideal conoaition
would be that the entire Court should sit in all cases to decide
questions of law, and for that reason the Supreme Court of the
United States does so. But having regard to the volurne of
work demanding the attention of the Court, it has been found
necessary in India as a general rule of practice and
convenience that the Court should sit in Divisions, each
Division being constituted of /udges whose number may be
determined by the exigencies of judicdal need, by the nature of
the case including any statutory mandate relative thereto, and
by such other considerations which the Chief /ustice, in whom
such authority devolves by convention, may find most
aooroonate. It is in order to guard against the possibility of
Inconsistent decisions on points of law by different Division
Benches that the Rule has been evolved, in order to promote
consistency and certainty in the develooment of the law and
its contemporary status, that the statement of the law by a
Division Bench Is considered binding on a Division Bench of the
same or lesser number of Judges. This prinaple has been
followed in Inala by several generations of / udges. ...”

13. Countering the above submission, learned Sr. Counsel Mr. Sisir Dutta
contended that the decision rendered in ShA//a Datta (supra) by a three
judge Bench is binding on the High Court and not the decision of earlier one
rendered in Micolletta Rohtag/ (supra). In support of the submission,

learned counsel placed reliance on a Division Bench judgment of this Court in

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 6 of 18
MAC Appl. No. 128/2016 (Eunus Alf Vs. Branch Manager, Ba/ja/
Allianz General [nsurance Co. Ltd). The Division bench observed as
under:

“12. The Supreme Court in the case of M.S. Sandhu Vs.
State of Punjab, (2014) 6 SCC 514 has held that in case of
contlict of co-ordinate Benches of equal strength, the latter
decision has to be followed spedally when earlier decision
rendered by co-ordinate Bench has been explained. Similar
view has been taken by a five-/udge Bench of the Madhya
Pradesh High Court in Jabalour Bus Operators Vs. State of
Madhya Pradesh, AlR 2003 (MP) 81 wherein it Is held that in
case of contlict of two Division Benches of equal strength, the
decision of earlier Division Bench shall be followed exceot
when it is explained by the latter Division Bench. In view of
aforesaid enunciation of law and taking into account the
principle of stare decisis, the decision rendered in the cases of
Reshma Kumari and Munna Lal /ain is binding on this Court.”

14. A Full bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court in /aba/pur Bus
Operators Vs. State Of M.P. & Anr. reported A/R 2003 (MP) 81,
confronted with a similar question, that in case of conflicting views between
the decisions rendered by the co-equal Benches of the Apex Court, which

view to be followed by the High Court as a binding precedent, held as under:

“Having considered the matter with broader dimensions, we
find that various High Courts have given different opinion on
the question involved) Some hold that in case of conflict
between two judgments on a point of law, later deasion
should be followed; while others say that the Court should
follow the decision which Is correct and accurate whether it is
earlier or later. There are High Courts which hold that decision
of earlier Bench Is binding because of the theory of binding
precedent and Article 141 of the Constitution of Inala. There
are also deasions which hold that Single Judge differing from
another Single Judge decision should refer the case to Larger
Bench, otherwise he Is bound by it. Deasions which are
rendered without considering the decisions expressing contrary
view have no value as a precedent. But in our considered
opinion, the position may be stated thus
With regard to the High Court, a Single Bench Is bound

by the decision of another Single Bench. In case, he
does not agree with the view of the other Single Bench,

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 7 of 18
he should refer the matter to the Larger Bench.
Similarly, Division Bench Is bound by the judgment of
earlier Division Bench. In case, it does not agree with
the view of the earlier Division Bench, it should refer
the matter to Larger Bench. !n case of conflict between
Juagments of two Division Benches of equal strength,
the decision of earlier Division Bench shall be followed
exceot when it Is explained by the latter Division Bench
In Which case the decision of later Division Bench shall
be binding. The decision of Larger Bench Is binding on
Smaller Benches.

/n case of conflict between two decisions of the Aoex Court,
Benches comprising of egual number of /udges, decision of
earlier Bench is binding unless explained by the latter Bench of
equal strength, in which case the later decision Is binding.
Decision of a Larger Bench Is binding on smaller Benches.
Therefore, the decision of earlier Division Bench, unless
distinguished by latter Division Bench, Is binding on the High
Courts and the Subordinate Courts. Similarly, in presence of
Division Bench decisions and Larger Bench deasions, the
decisions of Larger Bench are binding on the High Courts and
the Subordinate Courts. No decision of Apex Court has been
brought to our notice which holds that in case of conflict
between the two decisions by equal number of /udges, the
later decision in binding in all arcumstances, or the High
Courts and Subordinate Courts can follow any decision which Is
found correct and accurate to the case under consideration.
High Courts and Subordinate Courts should lack cormpetence to
Interoret decisions of Aoex Court since that would not only
defeat what Is envisaged under Article 141 of the Constitution
of Inala but also militate hierarchical suyoremacy of Courts. The
common thread which runs through various decisions of Aoex
Court seems to be that great value has to be attached to
precedent which has taken the shape of rule being followed by
It for the purpose of consistency and exactness in decisions of
Court, unless the Court can Clearly distinguish the decision put
ujo as a precedent or is per incunam, having been rendered
without noticing some earlier precedents with which the Court
agrees. Full Bench decision in Balbir Singh's case (supra) which
holds that if there is conflict of views between the two coequal Benches of the Apex Court, the High Court has to follow
the judgment which appears to it to state the law more
elaborately and more accurately and in conformity with the
scheme of the Act, in our considered opinion, for reasons
recorded in the preceding paragraoh of this judgment, does

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 8 of 18
not lay down the correct law as to application of precedent
and Is, therefore, over-ruled on this point.”

15. Although, with regard to right to file appeal by Insurance Company,
the Apex court in Nico//etta Rohtagi (Supra) expressed somewhat different
view, in the subsequent decision by three Judges Bench in ShAi//la Datta
(Supra), the Apex Court considered and explained the decision of M/co/letta
Rohtagi (supra) in detail and referred certain issues to larger Bench.
However, so far the question with regard to right of Insurance Company to
file appeal taking the ground in addition to Section 149 (2) MV Act, the Apex
Court clearly held that once the insurance company is made a party
respondent, irrespective of obtaining any leave under Section 170 MV Act,
can contest the claim and prefer appeal taking all grounds available to the
insured, besides the statutory defence under Section 149(2) MV Act.

16. In view of the above situation, when the Apex Court in SA//a Datta
(Supra) explained the earlier decision in NMicco/letta Rohtag/ (supra) and
decided the question as indicated above in favour of the insurer, | am of the
view, that in view of the decision of the Division Bench of this Court and also
the principle laid down by the Full Bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court, the
decision rendered by three judges Bench of Apex Court in Shi/la Datta
(Supra) subsequently, is binding on this Court. Be that as it may, while going
through the record of the Tribunal, | find that the Bajaj Allianz General
Insurance Company prayed for leave under Section 170 of the MV Act and
the Tribunal allowed the Insurance Company by order dated 01.06.2012 to
raise all defence, which could be raised by insured in addition to defence
available under Section 149(2). Therefore, the question raised by Mr. Surajit
Dutta challenging the right of the insurance company to prefer appeal, is
redundant, so far the Bajaj Alliance General Insurance Co. Ltd. is concerned.
So far the New India Assurance Co. is concerned, as per Shi/a Datta (supra)
case, the New India Assurance Co. having been impleaded as a party

respondent, obviously has the right to appeal. In that view of the matter, | do

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 9 of 18
not find any force in the submission of the learned counsel Mr. Surajit Dutta

that the appeal filed by the Insurance Companies are not maintainable.

17. Next point raised by Surajit Dutta was that the Bajaj Allianz General
Insurance Company is debarred from raising any defence on the basis of the
policy, in absence of evidence adduced by the Insurance Company inasmuch
as, the policy was not proved by the insurance company. To buttress the
submission, Mr. Dutta placed reliance on a decision of Patna High Court in
Sial Sinha Vs. Shivadhari Sinha & Ors. reported in A/R 1972 Patna 8&1.
There is no denial, that Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company did not file
written statement and for that matter, no evidence was also adduced,

however, it appeared subsequently and contested the case.

18. It transpires from the record, that the policy under which the vehicle
of the deceased was insured has been proved as Ext.10 by the claimant
himself. Since the policy has been proved and brought on evidence, it is
Immaterial who has adduced such evidence and proved the policy. Since
there is evidence on record, both the parties can rely upon such evidence, as
law never preclude any party from relying on the evidence adduced by the
Opposite party. Therefore, there is no bar on the part of the Insurance
Company in replying upon such documentary evidence, though adduced by
the claimant. The insurance policy (Ext.10) transpires that it was a package

policy for private vehicle.

19. Section 147 of the MV Act reads as under:

‘147 Requirements of policies and limits of liability. —
(1) In order to comply with the requirements of this Chapter, a
policy of insurance must be a policy which—
(a) is issued by a person who is an authorised insurer;
and
(fb) insures the person or classes of persons specified in
the policy to the extent specified in sub-section (2)—
(i) against any liability which may be incurred
by him in respect of the death of or bodily 2’
[injury to any person, including owner of the
goods or his authorised representative carried in

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 10 of 18
the vehicle] or damage to any property of a
third party caused by or arising out of the use
of the vehicle in a public place;
(ii) against the death of or bodily injury to any
passenger of a public service vehicle caused by
or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a
public place:
Provided that a policy shall not be required—
(i) to cover liability in respect of the death, arising out
of and in the course of his employment, of the
employee of a person insured by the policy or in
respect of bodily injury sustained by such an employee
arising out of and in the course of his employment
other than a liability arising under the Workmen's
Compensation Act, 1923 (8 of 1923) in respect of the
death of, or bodily injury to, any such employee—
(a) engaged in driving the vehicle, or
(b) if it is a public service vehicle engaged as
conductor of the vehicle or in examining tickets
on the vehicle, or
(c) if it is a goods carriage, being carried in the
vehicle, or
(ii) to cover any contractual liability.
Explanation. —For the removal of doubts, it is hereby
declared that the death of or bodily injury to any
person or damage to any property of a third party shall
be deemed to have been caused by or to have arisen
out of, the use of a vehicle in a public place
notwithstanding that the person who is dead or injured
or the property which is damaged was not in a public
place at the time of the accident, if the act or omission
which led to the accident occurred in a public place.
(2) Subject to the proviso to sub-section (1), a policy of
Insurance referred to in sub-section (1), shall cover any liability
Incurred in respect of any accident, up to the following limits,
namely: —
(a) Save as provided in clause (b), the amount of
liability incurred;
(b) In respect of damage to any property of a third
party, a limit of rupees six thousand:

Provided that any policy of insurance issued with any
limited liability and in force, immediately before the
commencement of this Act, shall continue to be effective for a
period of four months after such commencement or till the
date of expiry of such policy whichever ts earlier.

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 11 of 18
(3) A policy shall be of no effect for the purposes of this
Chapter unless and until there is issued by the insurer in
favour of the person by whom the policy is effected a
certificate of insurance in the prescribed form and containing
the prescribed particulars of any condition subject to which the
policy is issued and of any other prescribed matters; and
different forms, particulars and matters may be prescribed in
different cases.

(4) Where a cover note issued by the insurer under the
provisions of this Chapter or the rules made thereunder is not
followed by a policy of insurance within the prescribed time,
the insurer shall, within seven days of the expiry of the period
of the validity of the cover note, notify the fact to the
registering authority in whose records the vehicle to which the
cover note relates has been registered or to such other
authority as the State Government may prescribe.

(5) Notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time
being in force, an insurer issuing a policy of insurance under
this section shall be liable to indemnify the person or classes of
persons specified in the policy in respect of any liability which
the policy purports to cover in the case of that person or those
classes of persons.”

20. It would appear from the provision of Section 147 MV Act, that under
the policy, liability of Insurance Company is to indemnify the insured owner in
respect of death or injury of any third party, which also necessarily included
certain categories of employees mentioned in Clause (a), (b) and (c) of the
proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 147 MV act. It is also settled position of
law, that there are two types of insurance policy, one Is statutory policy and
the other is contractual policy. Under statutory policy, liability of the
Insurance Company Is limited to what is laid down in Section 147 of the MV
Act. Under Section 147 of the MV Act, Insurance Company has no liability to
pay any compensation in respect of death or injury of the owner/insured
himself, unless there is some contract between the insurer and the insured to
that effect. It is abundantly clear from the provision of Section 147 MV Act
and also Section 163-A or 140 MV Act that the liability to pay compensation

to the victim of motor vehicle accident is basically on the owner of the

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 12 of 18
vehicle, which the insurer is required to indemnify by virtue of the contract of
the policy. The Apex Court in New /ndia Assurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Prabha
Devi & Ors. reported in (2013) 14 SCC 719, the Apex Court dealing with
the liability of the insurer in respect of death or injury of the insured held as

under:

‘8. We have perused the judgment of this Court in the case of
Dhanraj Supra. !n that case, the appellant who was the insurer
was travelling in the insured vehicle which met with an
acadent, In the acadent, the appellant as well as the other
passengers received injuries. A number of Claim petitions carne
to be filed. The appellant who was the insurer also filed a
Caim petition. The MACT held the ariver of the /eeo
responsible for the acadent. /n all the Claim petitions filed by
the other passengers, MACT airected that the appellant (the
owner) as well as the driver and the [Insurance Cormoany were
lable to pay cornpensation. Furthermore, in the Cdaim petition
filed by the appellant, the MACT directed the driver and the
/nsurance Company to pay compensation to the appellant. The
aforesaid finding of the MACT was upheld by the High Court in
the appeal filed by the Insurance Company. The Insurance
Company was, in appeal before this Court challenging the
Judgment of the High Court awarding cornoensation to the
owner of the insured vehicle. Taking into consideration the
provision contained in Section 147 of the Act, this Court
observed as follows :
“8. Thus, an insurance policy covers the lability
Incurred by the insured in respect of death of or bodily
Iryury to any person (including an owner of the goods
or his authorised reoresentative) carried in the vehicle
or damage to any property of a third party caused by
or arising out of the use of the vehicle. Section 147
does not require an insurance company to assume risk
for death or bodily injury to the owner of the vehicle.

9. In the case of Onental Insurance Co. Ltd. versus
Sunita Rathi it has been held that the lability of an
Insurance company Is only for the purpose of
Indermifying the insured against labilities incurred
towards a third person or in respect of darnages to
property. Thus, where the insured |.e. an owner of the
vehicle has no lability to a third party the insurance
company has no lability also.

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 13 of 18
10. In this case, it has not been shown that the policy
covered any risk for injury to the owner himself. We
are unable to acceot the contention that the premium
of Rs.4989 paid under the heading “Own damage’, the
words “oremium on vehicle and non-electrical
accessories” aooear. It Is thus Clear that this premium
Is towards damage to the vehicle and not for injury to
the person of the owner. An owner of a vehicle can
only claim provided a personal acadent insurance has
been taken out. /n this case there Is no such
insurance.”

9. In view of the aforesaid ratio of law, the claim made by the
resoondents could not have been allowed. Consequently, Civil
Appeal No. 479 of 2007 Is allowed. The imougned Award as
well as the imougned judgment of the High Court are set
aside.”

21. The perusal of the policy (Ext.10) shows, that the deceased as owner
of his vehicle, paid an extra premium for personal accident coverage and
therefore, the liability of the insurer in the instant case for death or injury of
the owner, could not be beyond what Is provided in the policy as per contract
between the insurer and insured. Since the deceased himself was the owner
of the vehicle insured with Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd, the Bajaj
Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd is not liable to pay any compensation as
directed by the Tribunal for the simple reason, that as per policy and also as
per the provision of Section 147 of the MV Act, Bajaj Allianz General
Insurance Co. Ltd has no liability for the death or injury of the owner, except,

what is provided in the policy under personal accident coverage.

22. Leaned counsel for both the Insurance Company submitted that while
calculating the loss of dependency, Tribunal deducted 1/3 of the income as
future prospect, whereas, as per the principle laid down in Sarla Verma
(Supra) such deduction for personal expenses ought to have been 1/2 of the
income. The Apex Court in Sar/a Verma (supra) held, that when deceased is
bachelor and claimants are parents, normally 50% of the income is to be
deducted as personal and living expenses. However, where the family of the

bachelor is large and dependent on the income of the deceased, the

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 14 of 18
deduction on personal expenses may be restricted to 1/3 and contribution of
the family shall be treated as 2/3. In the instant case, evidently there is no
other dependent except the mother of the deceased and therefore, as per the
principle laid down in Sar/a Verma (supra), deduction ought to have been
made 50% towards personal expenses of the deceased. What is to be noted
In the instant case is that Tribunal applied multiplier 11, with reference to the
age of the claimant, whereas, it is now settled principle of law, that multiplier
Shall be with reference of the age of the deceased and not with reference to
the age of the parents. Learned Tribunal seems to have fallen in error by
applying multiplier 11, which ought to have been 16 with reference to the
age of the deceased. Had the Tribunal took the proper multiplier 16, in that
case, even after deduction of 50% towards personal expenses, loss of
dependency would have remained almost same. The Apex Court in Ran/ana
Prakash And Ors vs The Divisional Manager And Anr reported in
(2011) 14 SCC 639 observed that irrespective of who files the appeal, the
appropriate course for the High Court is to examine the facts and by applying
the relevant principles, determine the just compensation i.e. award is just and
reasonable. The only embargo put on such obligation of the High Court in
determining just compensation is that in an appeal by insurance company for
reduction of compensation, enhancement of compensation is not permissible
without appeal by the claimant. Taking note of the fact that the Tribunal
wrongly took a lower multiplier, | am not inclined to interfere with the
decision of the Tribunal with regard to deduction towards personal expenses
for the reasons, that had the Tribunal applied proper multiplier, even after
deduction of 50%, loss of dependency would have been almost the same as
has been assessed by the Tribunal after deduction of 1/3 of the income

towards personal expenses.

23. Mr. Sisir Dutta, leaned Sr. Counsel, refereeing to the evidence of CW4 contended that the accident occurred due to rash & negligent driving of the
deceased and therefore, the owner insurer of the truck ought not to have

been held liable. The claimant examined 4 witnesses, out of which, CW-2 was

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 15 of 18
the eye witness, who was travelling in the vehicle with the deceased. The
CW-2 categorically stated that the truck was parked in the middle of the road
without any parking light and for negligent parking of the truck in the middle
of the road, the accident occurred. Accident Information Report, Ext.1 as well
as the charge sheet, Ext. 3 shows that the accident occurred due to fault of
the driver of the truck. CW-4 being police officer, who held preliminary
enquiry of the case, stated categorically that the truck was parked in the
middle of the road. However, he further stated that there were 12 fts. space
on the side of the divider and according to him, had the driver of the Santro
car drove the vehicle in a moderate speed, accident could have been avoided.
This part of the statement of CW-4 appears to be his opinion, whch does not
carry any evidentiary value. Apparently, CW-4 was not an eye witness and as
such he had no personal knowledge as to how the vehicle was driven or how
the accident occurred. But the categorical evidence of the eye witness, CW-2
that the truck was parked in the middle of the road without any back light,
because of which the accident occurred, supported by the documentary
evidence being the charge sheet, left no room for any speculation as to who

was at fault for the accident.

24. However, considering the facts and circumstances of the case and the
totality of the evidence, learned Tribunal in its wisdom apportioned the
liability attributing same amount of contributory negligence to the deceased, |
do not find any fault with such finding of the Tribunal in apportioning the
liability fixing 40% contributory negligence on the deceased, inasmuch as, the
claimant or the insurer of the Santro car has not challenged the finding of the

Tribunal with regard to apportionment of the liability.

25. The next point raised by learned Sr. Counsel Mr. S. Dutta is that while
assessing the income, the Tribunal did not deduct income tax. Referring to
the decision of the Apex Court in Sarfa Verma (supra), learned counsel
submits that only net income or the ‘take home pay’ after deduction of tax is

required to be taken into consideration for purpose of assessing loss of

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 16 of 18
dependency. The claimant has stated that salary of the deceased, who was a
Mechanical Engineer was Rs. 38,438/- and proved a salary certificate issued
by his employer as Ext.11. The author of the Ext.11 was also examined, but
during cross examination of the author of the Ext.11, no question was put to
the author of the certificate, whether the amount of salary mentioned in Ext.1
was the ‘take home pay’ after deducting tax etc. or not. The insurance
company has also not adduced any evidence that the salary shown in the
Ext.11 and also deposed by the claimant was not the net pay after deducting
Income tax. |n absence of such evidence, | am of the view that no deduction
towards income tax could be made. Another point raised by Mr. S. Dutta
referring to the cross examination of CW-1, that deceased used to send Rs.
7000/- to her every month by Money Order. Learned counsel Mr. S. Dutta
contended that this Rs. 7000/- was the only contribution to the family and
therefore loss of dependency ought to have been assessed on the basis of
the said contribution of Rs. 7000/- per month only. | do not find any force in
this submission of the learned counsel, for the simple reason, that only
because the deceased used to send Rs. 7000/- per month by Money Order
that itself would not necessarily mean, that the deceased was not looking

after his parents or did not contribute to the family.

26. In view of the forgoing discussions, | am of the view that the
compensation determined by the Tribunal in the instant case warrant no
interference. However, since the deceased also contributed to the accident to
the extent of 40% as decided by the Tribunal, the claimant cannot get any
compensation for the wrong done by deceased himself and therefore, the
claimant shall be entitled only to 60% of the compensation determined by the
Tribunal to be satisfied by the New India Assurance Co. Ltd.. The accident
having taken place due to contributory negligence of the deceased, who was
owner of the vehicle insured with Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd.,
Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd. cannot be saddled with the
responsibility to satisfy the 40% of the award as directed by the Tribunal, as

one cannot get compensation for his own fault in claim under Section 166 MV

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 17 of 18
Mkk

Act. That apart, deceased not being third party, so far Bajaj Allianz | nsurance
Co. is concerned, the insurer of the deceased/owner is not liable to pay

compensation for the death of the owner/insured.

2/. With the above modification in the award with regard to liability of the
appellant Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd, the appeal filed by Bajaj
Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd is allowed and the appeal filed New India
Assurance Co. Ltd. is dismissed.

Date of hearing : 03.08.2017

JUDGMENT & ORDER

These two appeals are filed by New India Assurance Co. Ltd. and
Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd., respectively, challenging the
judgment and award dated 12.07.2013 passed by MACT, Tinsukia in Mac
Case No. 29/2011.

MAC Appl. 272/2014 Page 1 of 18
2. Brief facts, which led to the present appeals are that on 31.03.2010,
Late Dipankar Kakati was travelling in a car bearing registration No. As-23/F1209 from Guwahati to Digboi. The car was driven by Late Dipankar Kakati,
who was the owner of the vehicle. The said car driven by deceased Dipankar
Kakati met with an accident after hitting against a standing truck, which was
parked on the middle of road without any parking light or indicator. As a
result of the accident, he sustained injuries and died. The parents of Late
Dipankar Kakati filed a claim petition before the MACT, Tinsukia, and the
learned Tribunal passed an award of Rs. 30,86,289/- with interest @ 6%. The
learned Tribunal apportioned the liability attributing contributory negligence
to the deceased to the extent of 40%. The vehicle owned and driven by
deceased was insured with the appellant Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co.
Ltd. and the truck involved in the accident was insured with New India
Assurance Co. Ltd.

3. Aggrieved by the judgment and award, both the Insurance Companies

have preferred the respective appeals.

4. The Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd., appellant in MAC Appl.
221/2015 raised the following points in its appeal No. 221/2015.

(i) The deceased was owner of the car and the accident having taken
place for negligence of the deceased himself, the insurer of the car
was not liable to pay any compensation, as under the policy, liability
of the Insurance Company was to indemnify the insured in respect of
claim of third party only. The deceased being owner and diver of the
vehicle, insured with Bajaj Alianz General Insurnce Co. Ltd., Tribunal
ought not to have held the insurer of the deceased, responsible for
satisfying 40% of the award.

(il) The Tribunal wrongly deducted 1/3 of the income towards personal
expenses, which as per the principle laid down in Sarala Verma
(Smt.) Vs. Delhi Transport Corp. reported in (2009) 6 SCC 121;

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 2 of 18
ought to have been 1/2 of the income, as the claim petition was filed

by mother, for death of her son.

5. The appellant in MAC Appl. 272/2014 raised the following points:

(i) While assessing loss of dependency, learned Tribunal did not
deduct the professional tax and income tax from the gross
income of the deceased.

(ii) Assessment of dependency was wrong.

(ili) © The accident occurred due to the fault of the deceased himself
and therefore, insurer of the standing truck ought not to have
been saddled with the liability to satisfy the award

(iv) | The claimant being parents, the Tribunal ought not to have

granted consortium.

6. Learned Sr. Counsel, Mr. S. Dutta for the New India Assurance Co.
Ltd., learned counsel Mr. R. Goswami for the Bajaj Allianz General Insurance
Co. Ltd. and learned counsel Mr. Surajit Dutta for the respondents were

heard at length.

7. Leaned counsel Mr. R. Goswami, contended that as per the policy, the
Insurer of the vehicle, owned by the deceased was not liable to pay any
compensation, as the deceased was not a third party. As per Section 147 of the
MV Act, liability of the Insurance Company is to indemnify the insured, for any
claim against the owner, in respect of death or injury of a third party. Learned
counsel also submitted that the Tribunal ought to have deducted 50% of the
Income while assessing the loss of dependency, considering the fact, that the
claim petition was by mother for the death of son and there was no other
dependents, but deduction of 1/3 in the instant case was improper as the
deceased left no other dependent except the parents and claim petition was filed

by his mother.

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 3 of 18
8. Mr. Surajit Dutta, learned counsel for the respondent/claimant
vehemently arguing on the locus of both the Insurance Co. to prefer appeal,
contended that the case was proceeded ex-parte against the Bajaj Allianz
General Insurance Company before the Tribunal and therefore, the said
company has no right to file appeal. Further contention of the learned
counsel was that the New India Assurance Co. having not obtained leave
under Section 170 MV Act is also not entitled to challenge the quantum of
award in appeal. In support of his submission, learned counsel placed
reliance on the decision of the Apex Court in National /[nsurance Co. Ltd.
Vs. Nicolletta Rohtagi, reported in (2002) 7 SCC 456. Mr. Surajit Dutta
also contended that although in a subsequent decision of United /ndta
/nsurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Shila Datta reported in (2011) 10 SCC 509, a
contrary view was taken by the Apex Court, the decision of Nico/letta

(Supra) being earlier in point of time is binding.

9. The Apex Court in Mico//etta Rahtog/ (supra) dealing with the right
of the insurance company to prefer appeal on merit of the claim and quantum

of compensation observed as under:

‘For the aforesaid reasons, an insurer If aggrieved against an
award, may file an appeal only on those grounds and no other.
However, by virtue of Section 170 of the 1988 Act, where in
course of an enguiry the Claims Tribunal Is satisfied that (a )
there Is a collusion between the person making a Claim and
the person against whom the Claim has been made or (b) the
person against whom the Caim has been made has failed to
contest the claim, the tribunal may, for reasons to be recorded
in writing, impolead the insurer and in that case it 1s permissible
for the insurer to contest the claim also on the grounds which
are available to the insured or to the person against whom the
Claim has been made. Thus, unless an order Is passed by the
tribunal permitting the insurer to avail the grounds available to
an insured or any other person against whom a Claim has been
made on being satisfied of the two conalitions soecitied in
Section 170 of the Act, it is not permissible to the insurer to
contest the daim on the grounds which are available to the
Insured or to a person against whom a claim has been made.
Thus where conaitions precedent embodied in Section 170 Is

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 4 of 18
satistied and award Is adverse to the interest of the insurer,
the insurer has a noht to file an appeal challenging the
guantum of compensation or negligence or contributory
negligence of the offending vehicle even if the insured has not
filed any appeal against the quantum of compensation.
Sections 149, 170 and 173 are part of one Scheme and if we
give any different interpretation to Section 173 of the 1988
Act, the same would go contrary to the scheme and object of
the Act.”

10. A three Judges Bench of the Apex Court in Shi/a Datta (supra)
answering the question whether insurer can contest a motor accident claim
on merit in regard to the quantum in addition to the ground mentioned in
Section 149(2) of the Act for avoiding liability under the policy of insurance
held as under:

‘Therefore, where the insurer is a party- respondent, either on
account of being impleaded as a party by the tribunal under
section 170 or being impleaded as a party-respondent by the
claimants in the claim petition voluntarily, it will be entitled to
contest the matter by raising all grounds, without being
restricted to the grounds available under section 149(2) of the
Act. The claim petition is maintainable against the owner and
driver without impleading the insurer as a party”

11. As per Shila Datta (supra) case, once the insurance company Is
made party respondent, irrespective of the fact, whether it is made party by
the claimant or by the Tribunal under Section 170 MV Act, it can raise all
grounds including the grounds, which are available to the insured. What
therefore follows from S/A//a Datta (supra) is that, when the insurance
company is made party even by the claimant, it can contest the claim raising
all defence available to insured and the question of obtaining leave as

contemplated in Section 170 MV Act becomes redundtant.

12. Mr. Surajit Dutta placing reliance on the decision of the Apex Court in
Sundip Kumar Batna Vs. State of Maharashtra reported in (2014) 16
SCC 623 submitted that when the co-equal Benches of equal strength of

judges of the Apex court are divergence of views, the view taken in the

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 5 of 18
former decision is binding and not the decision rendered subsequently by coequal Bench. Mr. Surajit Dutta, in support of his submission placed reliance

on paragraph - 17 of the judgment, which is reproduced below:

“17. The Constitution Bench in Union of India vs Raghubir
Singh, 1989 (2) SCC 754, has come to the condusion
extracted below:

‘27. What then should be the position in regard to the effect
of the law pronounced by a Division Bench in relation to a case
raising the same point subsequently before a Division Bench of
a smaller number of Judges? There is no constitutional or
statutory prescription in the matter, and the point is governed
entirely by the practice in India of the courts sanctified by
reoeated affirmation over a century of time. /t cannot be
doubted that in order to promote consistency and certainty in
the law laid down by a superior Court, the ideal conoaition
would be that the entire Court should sit in all cases to decide
questions of law, and for that reason the Supreme Court of the
United States does so. But having regard to the volurne of
work demanding the attention of the Court, it has been found
necessary in India as a general rule of practice and
convenience that the Court should sit in Divisions, each
Division being constituted of /udges whose number may be
determined by the exigencies of judicdal need, by the nature of
the case including any statutory mandate relative thereto, and
by such other considerations which the Chief /ustice, in whom
such authority devolves by convention, may find most
aooroonate. It is in order to guard against the possibility of
Inconsistent decisions on points of law by different Division
Benches that the Rule has been evolved, in order to promote
consistency and certainty in the develooment of the law and
its contemporary status, that the statement of the law by a
Division Bench Is considered binding on a Division Bench of the
same or lesser number of Judges. This prinaple has been
followed in Inala by several generations of / udges. ...”

13. Countering the above submission, learned Sr. Counsel Mr. Sisir Dutta
contended that the decision rendered in ShA//a Datta (supra) by a three
judge Bench is binding on the High Court and not the decision of earlier one
rendered in Micolletta Rohtag/ (supra). In support of the submission,

learned counsel placed reliance on a Division Bench judgment of this Court in

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 6 of 18
MAC Appl. No. 128/2016 (Eunus Alf Vs. Branch Manager, Ba/ja/
Allianz General [nsurance Co. Ltd). The Division bench observed as
under:

“12. The Supreme Court in the case of M.S. Sandhu Vs.
State of Punjab, (2014) 6 SCC 514 has held that in case of
contlict of co-ordinate Benches of equal strength, the latter
decision has to be followed spedally when earlier decision
rendered by co-ordinate Bench has been explained. Similar
view has been taken by a five-/udge Bench of the Madhya
Pradesh High Court in Jabalour Bus Operators Vs. State of
Madhya Pradesh, AlR 2003 (MP) 81 wherein it Is held that in
case of contlict of two Division Benches of equal strength, the
decision of earlier Division Bench shall be followed exceot
when it is explained by the latter Division Bench. In view of
aforesaid enunciation of law and taking into account the
principle of stare decisis, the decision rendered in the cases of
Reshma Kumari and Munna Lal /ain is binding on this Court.”

14. A Full bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court in /aba/pur Bus
Operators Vs. State Of M.P. & Anr. reported A/R 2003 (MP) 81,
confronted with a similar question, that in case of conflicting views between
the decisions rendered by the co-equal Benches of the Apex Court, which

view to be followed by the High Court as a binding precedent, held as under:

“Having considered the matter with broader dimensions, we
find that various High Courts have given different opinion on
the question involved) Some hold that in case of conflict
between two judgments on a point of law, later deasion
should be followed; while others say that the Court should
follow the decision which Is correct and accurate whether it is
earlier or later. There are High Courts which hold that decision
of earlier Bench Is binding because of the theory of binding
precedent and Article 141 of the Constitution of Inala. There
are also deasions which hold that Single Judge differing from
another Single Judge decision should refer the case to Larger
Bench, otherwise he Is bound by it. Deasions which are
rendered without considering the decisions expressing contrary
view have no value as a precedent. But in our considered
opinion, the position may be stated thus
With regard to the High Court, a Single Bench Is bound

by the decision of another Single Bench. In case, he
does not agree with the view of the other Single Bench,

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 7 of 18
he should refer the matter to the Larger Bench.
Similarly, Division Bench Is bound by the judgment of
earlier Division Bench. In case, it does not agree with
the view of the earlier Division Bench, it should refer
the matter to Larger Bench. !n case of conflict between
Juagments of two Division Benches of equal strength,
the decision of earlier Division Bench shall be followed
exceot when it Is explained by the latter Division Bench
In Which case the decision of later Division Bench shall
be binding. The decision of Larger Bench Is binding on
Smaller Benches.

/n case of conflict between two decisions of the Aoex Court,
Benches comprising of egual number of /udges, decision of
earlier Bench is binding unless explained by the latter Bench of
equal strength, in which case the later decision Is binding.
Decision of a Larger Bench Is binding on smaller Benches.
Therefore, the decision of earlier Division Bench, unless
distinguished by latter Division Bench, Is binding on the High
Courts and the Subordinate Courts. Similarly, in presence of
Division Bench decisions and Larger Bench deasions, the
decisions of Larger Bench are binding on the High Courts and
the Subordinate Courts. No decision of Apex Court has been
brought to our notice which holds that in case of conflict
between the two decisions by equal number of /udges, the
later decision in binding in all arcumstances, or the High
Courts and Subordinate Courts can follow any decision which Is
found correct and accurate to the case under consideration.
High Courts and Subordinate Courts should lack cormpetence to
Interoret decisions of Aoex Court since that would not only
defeat what Is envisaged under Article 141 of the Constitution
of Inala but also militate hierarchical suyoremacy of Courts. The
common thread which runs through various decisions of Aoex
Court seems to be that great value has to be attached to
precedent which has taken the shape of rule being followed by
It for the purpose of consistency and exactness in decisions of
Court, unless the Court can Clearly distinguish the decision put
ujo as a precedent or is per incunam, having been rendered
without noticing some earlier precedents with which the Court
agrees. Full Bench decision in Balbir Singh's case (supra) which
holds that if there is conflict of views between the two coequal Benches of the Apex Court, the High Court has to follow
the judgment which appears to it to state the law more
elaborately and more accurately and in conformity with the
scheme of the Act, in our considered opinion, for reasons
recorded in the preceding paragraoh of this judgment, does

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 8 of 18
not lay down the correct law as to application of precedent
and Is, therefore, over-ruled on this point.”

15. Although, with regard to right to file appeal by Insurance Company,
the Apex court in Nico//etta Rohtagi (Supra) expressed somewhat different
view, in the subsequent decision by three Judges Bench in ShAi//la Datta
(Supra), the Apex Court considered and explained the decision of M/co/letta
Rohtagi (supra) in detail and referred certain issues to larger Bench.
However, so far the question with regard to right of Insurance Company to
file appeal taking the ground in addition to Section 149 (2) MV Act, the Apex
Court clearly held that once the insurance company is made a party
respondent, irrespective of obtaining any leave under Section 170 MV Act,
can contest the claim and prefer appeal taking all grounds available to the
insured, besides the statutory defence under Section 149(2) MV Act.

16. In view of the above situation, when the Apex Court in SA//a Datta
(Supra) explained the earlier decision in NMicco/letta Rohtag/ (supra) and
decided the question as indicated above in favour of the insurer, | am of the
view, that in view of the decision of the Division Bench of this Court and also
the principle laid down by the Full Bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court, the
decision rendered by three judges Bench of Apex Court in Shi/la Datta
(Supra) subsequently, is binding on this Court. Be that as it may, while going
through the record of the Tribunal, | find that the Bajaj Allianz General
Insurance Company prayed for leave under Section 170 of the MV Act and
the Tribunal allowed the Insurance Company by order dated 01.06.2012 to
raise all defence, which could be raised by insured in addition to defence
available under Section 149(2). Therefore, the question raised by Mr. Surajit
Dutta challenging the right of the insurance company to prefer appeal, is
redundant, so far the Bajaj Alliance General Insurance Co. Ltd. is concerned.
So far the New India Assurance Co. is concerned, as per Shi/a Datta (supra)
case, the New India Assurance Co. having been impleaded as a party

respondent, obviously has the right to appeal. In that view of the matter, | do

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 9 of 18
not find any force in the submission of the learned counsel Mr. Surajit Dutta

that the appeal filed by the Insurance Companies are not maintainable.

17. Next point raised by Surajit Dutta was that the Bajaj Allianz General
Insurance Company is debarred from raising any defence on the basis of the
policy, in absence of evidence adduced by the Insurance Company inasmuch
as, the policy was not proved by the insurance company. To buttress the
submission, Mr. Dutta placed reliance on a decision of Patna High Court in
Sial Sinha Vs. Shivadhari Sinha & Ors. reported in A/R 1972 Patna 8&1.
There is no denial, that Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company did not file
written statement and for that matter, no evidence was also adduced,

however, it appeared subsequently and contested the case.

18. It transpires from the record, that the policy under which the vehicle
of the deceased was insured has been proved as Ext.10 by the claimant
himself. Since the policy has been proved and brought on evidence, it is
Immaterial who has adduced such evidence and proved the policy. Since
there is evidence on record, both the parties can rely upon such evidence, as
law never preclude any party from relying on the evidence adduced by the
Opposite party. Therefore, there is no bar on the part of the Insurance
Company in replying upon such documentary evidence, though adduced by
the claimant. The insurance policy (Ext.10) transpires that it was a package

policy for private vehicle.

19. Section 147 of the MV Act reads as under:

‘147 Requirements of policies and limits of liability. —
(1) In order to comply with the requirements of this Chapter, a
policy of insurance must be a policy which—
(a) is issued by a person who is an authorised insurer;
and
(fb) insures the person or classes of persons specified in
the policy to the extent specified in sub-section (2)—
(i) against any liability which may be incurred
by him in respect of the death of or bodily 2’
[injury to any person, including owner of the
goods or his authorised representative carried in

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 10 of 18
the vehicle] or damage to any property of a
third party caused by or arising out of the use
of the vehicle in a public place;
(ii) against the death of or bodily injury to any
passenger of a public service vehicle caused by
or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a
public place:
Provided that a policy shall not be required—
(i) to cover liability in respect of the death, arising out
of and in the course of his employment, of the
employee of a person insured by the policy or in
respect of bodily injury sustained by such an employee
arising out of and in the course of his employment
other than a liability arising under the Workmen's
Compensation Act, 1923 (8 of 1923) in respect of the
death of, or bodily injury to, any such employee—
(a) engaged in driving the vehicle, or
(b) if it is a public service vehicle engaged as
conductor of the vehicle or in examining tickets
on the vehicle, or
(c) if it is a goods carriage, being carried in the
vehicle, or
(ii) to cover any contractual liability.
Explanation. —For the removal of doubts, it is hereby
declared that the death of or bodily injury to any
person or damage to any property of a third party shall
be deemed to have been caused by or to have arisen
out of, the use of a vehicle in a public place
notwithstanding that the person who is dead or injured
or the property which is damaged was not in a public
place at the time of the accident, if the act or omission
which led to the accident occurred in a public place.
(2) Subject to the proviso to sub-section (1), a policy of
Insurance referred to in sub-section (1), shall cover any liability
Incurred in respect of any accident, up to the following limits,
namely: —
(a) Save as provided in clause (b), the amount of
liability incurred;
(b) In respect of damage to any property of a third
party, a limit of rupees six thousand:

Provided that any policy of insurance issued with any
limited liability and in force, immediately before the
commencement of this Act, shall continue to be effective for a
period of four months after such commencement or till the
date of expiry of such policy whichever ts earlier.

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 11 of 18
(3) A policy shall be of no effect for the purposes of this
Chapter unless and until there is issued by the insurer in
favour of the person by whom the policy is effected a
certificate of insurance in the prescribed form and containing
the prescribed particulars of any condition subject to which the
policy is issued and of any other prescribed matters; and
different forms, particulars and matters may be prescribed in
different cases.

(4) Where a cover note issued by the insurer under the
provisions of this Chapter or the rules made thereunder is not
followed by a policy of insurance within the prescribed time,
the insurer shall, within seven days of the expiry of the period
of the validity of the cover note, notify the fact to the
registering authority in whose records the vehicle to which the
cover note relates has been registered or to such other
authority as the State Government may prescribe.

(5) Notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time
being in force, an insurer issuing a policy of insurance under
this section shall be liable to indemnify the person or classes of
persons specified in the policy in respect of any liability which
the policy purports to cover in the case of that person or those
classes of persons.”

20. It would appear from the provision of Section 147 MV Act, that under
the policy, liability of Insurance Company is to indemnify the insured owner in
respect of death or injury of any third party, which also necessarily included
certain categories of employees mentioned in Clause (a), (b) and (c) of the
proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 147 MV act. It is also settled position of
law, that there are two types of insurance policy, one Is statutory policy and
the other is contractual policy. Under statutory policy, liability of the
Insurance Company Is limited to what is laid down in Section 147 of the MV
Act. Under Section 147 of the MV Act, Insurance Company has no liability to
pay any compensation in respect of death or injury of the owner/insured
himself, unless there is some contract between the insurer and the insured to
that effect. It is abundantly clear from the provision of Section 147 MV Act
and also Section 163-A or 140 MV Act that the liability to pay compensation

to the victim of motor vehicle accident is basically on the owner of the

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 12 of 18
vehicle, which the insurer is required to indemnify by virtue of the contract of
the policy. The Apex Court in New /ndia Assurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Prabha
Devi & Ors. reported in (2013) 14 SCC 719, the Apex Court dealing with
the liability of the insurer in respect of death or injury of the insured held as

under:

‘8. We have perused the judgment of this Court in the case of
Dhanraj Supra. !n that case, the appellant who was the insurer
was travelling in the insured vehicle which met with an
acadent, In the acadent, the appellant as well as the other
passengers received injuries. A number of Claim petitions carne
to be filed. The appellant who was the insurer also filed a
Caim petition. The MACT held the ariver of the /eeo
responsible for the acadent. /n all the Claim petitions filed by
the other passengers, MACT airected that the appellant (the
owner) as well as the driver and the [Insurance Cormoany were
lable to pay cornpensation. Furthermore, in the Cdaim petition
filed by the appellant, the MACT directed the driver and the
/nsurance Company to pay compensation to the appellant. The
aforesaid finding of the MACT was upheld by the High Court in
the appeal filed by the Insurance Company. The Insurance
Company was, in appeal before this Court challenging the
Judgment of the High Court awarding cornoensation to the
owner of the insured vehicle. Taking into consideration the
provision contained in Section 147 of the Act, this Court
observed as follows :
“8. Thus, an insurance policy covers the lability
Incurred by the insured in respect of death of or bodily
Iryury to any person (including an owner of the goods
or his authorised reoresentative) carried in the vehicle
or damage to any property of a third party caused by
or arising out of the use of the vehicle. Section 147
does not require an insurance company to assume risk
for death or bodily injury to the owner of the vehicle.

9. In the case of Onental Insurance Co. Ltd. versus
Sunita Rathi it has been held that the lability of an
Insurance company Is only for the purpose of
Indermifying the insured against labilities incurred
towards a third person or in respect of darnages to
property. Thus, where the insured |.e. an owner of the
vehicle has no lability to a third party the insurance
company has no lability also.

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 13 of 18
10. In this case, it has not been shown that the policy
covered any risk for injury to the owner himself. We
are unable to acceot the contention that the premium
of Rs.4989 paid under the heading “Own damage’, the
words “oremium on vehicle and non-electrical
accessories” aooear. It Is thus Clear that this premium
Is towards damage to the vehicle and not for injury to
the person of the owner. An owner of a vehicle can
only claim provided a personal acadent insurance has
been taken out. /n this case there Is no such
insurance.”

9. In view of the aforesaid ratio of law, the claim made by the
resoondents could not have been allowed. Consequently, Civil
Appeal No. 479 of 2007 Is allowed. The imougned Award as
well as the imougned judgment of the High Court are set
aside.”

21. The perusal of the policy (Ext.10) shows, that the deceased as owner
of his vehicle, paid an extra premium for personal accident coverage and
therefore, the liability of the insurer in the instant case for death or injury of
the owner, could not be beyond what Is provided in the policy as per contract
between the insurer and insured. Since the deceased himself was the owner
of the vehicle insured with Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd, the Bajaj
Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd is not liable to pay any compensation as
directed by the Tribunal for the simple reason, that as per policy and also as
per the provision of Section 147 of the MV Act, Bajaj Allianz General
Insurance Co. Ltd has no liability for the death or injury of the owner, except,

what is provided in the policy under personal accident coverage.

22. Leaned counsel for both the Insurance Company submitted that while
calculating the loss of dependency, Tribunal deducted 1/3 of the income as
future prospect, whereas, as per the principle laid down in Sarla Verma
(Supra) such deduction for personal expenses ought to have been 1/2 of the
income. The Apex Court in Sar/a Verma (supra) held, that when deceased is
bachelor and claimants are parents, normally 50% of the income is to be
deducted as personal and living expenses. However, where the family of the

bachelor is large and dependent on the income of the deceased, the

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 14 of 18
deduction on personal expenses may be restricted to 1/3 and contribution of
the family shall be treated as 2/3. In the instant case, evidently there is no
other dependent except the mother of the deceased and therefore, as per the
principle laid down in Sar/a Verma (supra), deduction ought to have been
made 50% towards personal expenses of the deceased. What is to be noted
In the instant case is that Tribunal applied multiplier 11, with reference to the
age of the claimant, whereas, it is now settled principle of law, that multiplier
Shall be with reference of the age of the deceased and not with reference to
the age of the parents. Learned Tribunal seems to have fallen in error by
applying multiplier 11, which ought to have been 16 with reference to the
age of the deceased. Had the Tribunal took the proper multiplier 16, in that
case, even after deduction of 50% towards personal expenses, loss of
dependency would have remained almost same. The Apex Court in Ran/ana
Prakash And Ors vs The Divisional Manager And Anr reported in
(2011) 14 SCC 639 observed that irrespective of who files the appeal, the
appropriate course for the High Court is to examine the facts and by applying
the relevant principles, determine the just compensation i.e. award is just and
reasonable. The only embargo put on such obligation of the High Court in
determining just compensation is that in an appeal by insurance company for
reduction of compensation, enhancement of compensation is not permissible
without appeal by the claimant. Taking note of the fact that the Tribunal
wrongly took a lower multiplier, | am not inclined to interfere with the
decision of the Tribunal with regard to deduction towards personal expenses
for the reasons, that had the Tribunal applied proper multiplier, even after
deduction of 50%, loss of dependency would have been almost the same as
has been assessed by the Tribunal after deduction of 1/3 of the income

towards personal expenses.

23. Mr. Sisir Dutta, leaned Sr. Counsel, refereeing to the evidence of CW4 contended that the accident occurred due to rash & negligent driving of the
deceased and therefore, the owner insurer of the truck ought not to have

been held liable. The claimant examined 4 witnesses, out of which, CW-2 was

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 15 of 18
the eye witness, who was travelling in the vehicle with the deceased. The
CW-2 categorically stated that the truck was parked in the middle of the road
without any parking light and for negligent parking of the truck in the middle
of the road, the accident occurred. Accident Information Report, Ext.1 as well
as the charge sheet, Ext. 3 shows that the accident occurred due to fault of
the driver of the truck. CW-4 being police officer, who held preliminary
enquiry of the case, stated categorically that the truck was parked in the
middle of the road. However, he further stated that there were 12 fts. space
on the side of the divider and according to him, had the driver of the Santro
car drove the vehicle in a moderate speed, accident could have been avoided.
This part of the statement of CW-4 appears to be his opinion, whch does not
carry any evidentiary value. Apparently, CW-4 was not an eye witness and as
such he had no personal knowledge as to how the vehicle was driven or how
the accident occurred. But the categorical evidence of the eye witness, CW-2
that the truck was parked in the middle of the road without any back light,
because of which the accident occurred, supported by the documentary
evidence being the charge sheet, left no room for any speculation as to who

was at fault for the accident.

24. However, considering the facts and circumstances of the case and the
totality of the evidence, learned Tribunal in its wisdom apportioned the
liability attributing same amount of contributory negligence to the deceased, |
do not find any fault with such finding of the Tribunal in apportioning the
liability fixing 40% contributory negligence on the deceased, inasmuch as, the
claimant or the insurer of the Santro car has not challenged the finding of the

Tribunal with regard to apportionment of the liability.

25. The next point raised by learned Sr. Counsel Mr. S. Dutta is that while
assessing the income, the Tribunal did not deduct income tax. Referring to
the decision of the Apex Court in Sarfa Verma (supra), learned counsel
submits that only net income or the ‘take home pay’ after deduction of tax is

required to be taken into consideration for purpose of assessing loss of

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 16 of 18
dependency. The claimant has stated that salary of the deceased, who was a
Mechanical Engineer was Rs. 38,438/- and proved a salary certificate issued
by his employer as Ext.11. The author of the Ext.11 was also examined, but
during cross examination of the author of the Ext.11, no question was put to
the author of the certificate, whether the amount of salary mentioned in Ext.1
was the ‘take home pay’ after deducting tax etc. or not. The insurance
company has also not adduced any evidence that the salary shown in the
Ext.11 and also deposed by the claimant was not the net pay after deducting
Income tax. |n absence of such evidence, | am of the view that no deduction
towards income tax could be made. Another point raised by Mr. S. Dutta
referring to the cross examination of CW-1, that deceased used to send Rs.
7000/- to her every month by Money Order. Learned counsel Mr. S. Dutta
contended that this Rs. 7000/- was the only contribution to the family and
therefore loss of dependency ought to have been assessed on the basis of
the said contribution of Rs. 7000/- per month only. | do not find any force in
this submission of the learned counsel, for the simple reason, that only
because the deceased used to send Rs. 7000/- per month by Money Order
that itself would not necessarily mean, that the deceased was not looking

after his parents or did not contribute to the family.

26. In view of the forgoing discussions, | am of the view that the
compensation determined by the Tribunal in the instant case warrant no
interference. However, since the deceased also contributed to the accident to
the extent of 40% as decided by the Tribunal, the claimant cannot get any
compensation for the wrong done by deceased himself and therefore, the
claimant shall be entitled only to 60% of the compensation determined by the
Tribunal to be satisfied by the New India Assurance Co. Ltd.. The accident
having taken place due to contributory negligence of the deceased, who was
owner of the vehicle insured with Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd.,
Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd. cannot be saddled with the
responsibility to satisfy the 40% of the award as directed by the Tribunal, as

one cannot get compensation for his own fault in claim under Section 166 MV

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 17 of 18
Mkk

Act. That apart, deceased not being third party, so far Bajaj Allianz | nsurance
Co. is concerned, the insurer of the deceased/owner is not liable to pay

compensation for the death of the owner/insured.

2/. With the above modification in the award with regard to liability of the
appellant Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd, the appeal filed by Bajaj
Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd is allowed and the appeal filed New India
Assurance Co. Ltd. is dismissed.

JUDGMENT & ORDER

These two appeals are filed by New India Assurance Co. Ltd. and
Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd., respectively, challenging the
judgment and award dated 12.07.2013 passed by MACT, Tinsukia in Mac
Case No. 29/2011.

MAC Appl. 272/2014 Page 1 of 18
2. Brief facts, which led to the present appeals are that on 31.03.2010,
Late Dipankar Kakati was travelling in a car bearing registration No. As-23/F1209 from Guwahati to Digboi. The car was driven by Late Dipankar Kakati,
who was the owner of the vehicle. The said car driven by deceased Dipankar
Kakati met with an accident after hitting against a standing truck, which was
parked on the middle of road without any parking light or indicator. As a
result of the accident, he sustained injuries and died. The parents of Late
Dipankar Kakati filed a claim petition before the MACT, Tinsukia, and the
learned Tribunal passed an award of Rs. 30,86,289/- with interest @ 6%. The
learned Tribunal apportioned the liability attributing contributory negligence
to the deceased to the extent of 40%. The vehicle owned and driven by
deceased was insured with the appellant Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co.
Ltd. and the truck involved in the accident was insured with New India
Assurance Co. Ltd.

3. Aggrieved by the judgment and award, both the Insurance Companies

have preferred the respective appeals.

4. The Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd., appellant in MAC Appl.
221/2015 raised the following points in its appeal No. 221/2015.

(i) The deceased was owner of the car and the accident having taken
place for negligence of the deceased himself, the insurer of the car
was not liable to pay any compensation, as under the policy, liability
of the Insurance Company was to indemnify the insured in respect of
claim of third party only. The deceased being owner and diver of the
vehicle, insured with Bajaj Alianz General Insurnce Co. Ltd., Tribunal
ought not to have held the insurer of the deceased, responsible for
satisfying 40% of the award.

(il) The Tribunal wrongly deducted 1/3 of the income towards personal
expenses, which as per the principle laid down in Sarala Verma
(Smt.) Vs. Delhi Transport Corp. reported in (2009) 6 SCC 121;

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 2 of 18
ought to have been 1/2 of the income, as the claim petition was filed

by mother, for death of her son.

5. The appellant in MAC Appl. 272/2014 raised the following points:

(i) While assessing loss of dependency, learned Tribunal did not
deduct the professional tax and income tax from the gross
income of the deceased.

(ii) Assessment of dependency was wrong.

(ili) © The accident occurred due to the fault of the deceased himself
and therefore, insurer of the standing truck ought not to have
been saddled with the liability to satisfy the award

(iv) | The claimant being parents, the Tribunal ought not to have

granted consortium.

6. Learned Sr. Counsel, Mr. S. Dutta for the New India Assurance Co.
Ltd., learned counsel Mr. R. Goswami for the Bajaj Allianz General Insurance
Co. Ltd. and learned counsel Mr. Surajit Dutta for the respondents were

heard at length.

7. Leaned counsel Mr. R. Goswami, contended that as per the policy, the
Insurer of the vehicle, owned by the deceased was not liable to pay any
compensation, as the deceased was not a third party. As per Section 147 of the
MV Act, liability of the Insurance Company is to indemnify the insured, for any
claim against the owner, in respect of death or injury of a third party. Learned
counsel also submitted that the Tribunal ought to have deducted 50% of the
Income while assessing the loss of dependency, considering the fact, that the
claim petition was by mother for the death of son and there was no other
dependents, but deduction of 1/3 in the instant case was improper as the
deceased left no other dependent except the parents and claim petition was filed

by his mother.

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 3 of 18
8. Mr. Surajit Dutta, learned counsel for the respondent/claimant
vehemently arguing on the locus of both the Insurance Co. to prefer appeal,
contended that the case was proceeded ex-parte against the Bajaj Allianz
General Insurance Company before the Tribunal and therefore, the said
company has no right to file appeal. Further contention of the learned
counsel was that the New India Assurance Co. having not obtained leave
under Section 170 MV Act is also not entitled to challenge the quantum of
award in appeal. In support of his submission, learned counsel placed
reliance on the decision of the Apex Court in National /[nsurance Co. Ltd.
Vs. Nicolletta Rohtagi, reported in (2002) 7 SCC 456. Mr. Surajit Dutta
also contended that although in a subsequent decision of United /ndta
/nsurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Shila Datta reported in (2011) 10 SCC 509, a
contrary view was taken by the Apex Court, the decision of Nico/letta

(Supra) being earlier in point of time is binding.

9. The Apex Court in Mico//etta Rahtog/ (supra) dealing with the right
of the insurance company to prefer appeal on merit of the claim and quantum

of compensation observed as under:

‘For the aforesaid reasons, an insurer If aggrieved against an
award, may file an appeal only on those grounds and no other.
However, by virtue of Section 170 of the 1988 Act, where in
course of an enguiry the Claims Tribunal Is satisfied that (a )
there Is a collusion between the person making a Claim and
the person against whom the Claim has been made or (b) the
person against whom the Caim has been made has failed to
contest the claim, the tribunal may, for reasons to be recorded
in writing, impolead the insurer and in that case it 1s permissible
for the insurer to contest the claim also on the grounds which
are available to the insured or to the person against whom the
Claim has been made. Thus, unless an order Is passed by the
tribunal permitting the insurer to avail the grounds available to
an insured or any other person against whom a Claim has been
made on being satisfied of the two conalitions soecitied in
Section 170 of the Act, it is not permissible to the insurer to
contest the daim on the grounds which are available to the
Insured or to a person against whom a claim has been made.
Thus where conaitions precedent embodied in Section 170 Is

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 4 of 18
satistied and award Is adverse to the interest of the insurer,
the insurer has a noht to file an appeal challenging the
guantum of compensation or negligence or contributory
negligence of the offending vehicle even if the insured has not
filed any appeal against the quantum of compensation.
Sections 149, 170 and 173 are part of one Scheme and if we
give any different interpretation to Section 173 of the 1988
Act, the same would go contrary to the scheme and object of
the Act.”

10. A three Judges Bench of the Apex Court in Shi/a Datta (supra)
answering the question whether insurer can contest a motor accident claim
on merit in regard to the quantum in addition to the ground mentioned in
Section 149(2) of the Act for avoiding liability under the policy of insurance
held as under:

‘Therefore, where the insurer is a party- respondent, either on
account of being impleaded as a party by the tribunal under
section 170 or being impleaded as a party-respondent by the
claimants in the claim petition voluntarily, it will be entitled to
contest the matter by raising all grounds, without being
restricted to the grounds available under section 149(2) of the
Act. The claim petition is maintainable against the owner and
driver without impleading the insurer as a party”

11. As per Shila Datta (supra) case, once the insurance company Is
made party respondent, irrespective of the fact, whether it is made party by
the claimant or by the Tribunal under Section 170 MV Act, it can raise all
grounds including the grounds, which are available to the insured. What
therefore follows from S/A//a Datta (supra) is that, when the insurance
company is made party even by the claimant, it can contest the claim raising
all defence available to insured and the question of obtaining leave as

contemplated in Section 170 MV Act becomes redundtant.

12. Mr. Surajit Dutta placing reliance on the decision of the Apex Court in
Sundip Kumar Batna Vs. State of Maharashtra reported in (2014) 16
SCC 623 submitted that when the co-equal Benches of equal strength of

judges of the Apex court are divergence of views, the view taken in the

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 5 of 18
former decision is binding and not the decision rendered subsequently by coequal Bench. Mr. Surajit Dutta, in support of his submission placed reliance

on paragraph - 17 of the judgment, which is reproduced below:

“17. The Constitution Bench in Union of India vs Raghubir
Singh, 1989 (2) SCC 754, has come to the condusion
extracted below:

‘27. What then should be the position in regard to the effect
of the law pronounced by a Division Bench in relation to a case
raising the same point subsequently before a Division Bench of
a smaller number of Judges? There is no constitutional or
statutory prescription in the matter, and the point is governed
entirely by the practice in India of the courts sanctified by
reoeated affirmation over a century of time. /t cannot be
doubted that in order to promote consistency and certainty in
the law laid down by a superior Court, the ideal conoaition
would be that the entire Court should sit in all cases to decide
questions of law, and for that reason the Supreme Court of the
United States does so. But having regard to the volurne of
work demanding the attention of the Court, it has been found
necessary in India as a general rule of practice and
convenience that the Court should sit in Divisions, each
Division being constituted of /udges whose number may be
determined by the exigencies of judicdal need, by the nature of
the case including any statutory mandate relative thereto, and
by such other considerations which the Chief /ustice, in whom
such authority devolves by convention, may find most
aooroonate. It is in order to guard against the possibility of
Inconsistent decisions on points of law by different Division
Benches that the Rule has been evolved, in order to promote
consistency and certainty in the develooment of the law and
its contemporary status, that the statement of the law by a
Division Bench Is considered binding on a Division Bench of the
same or lesser number of Judges. This prinaple has been
followed in Inala by several generations of / udges. ...”

13. Countering the above submission, learned Sr. Counsel Mr. Sisir Dutta
contended that the decision rendered in ShA//a Datta (supra) by a three
judge Bench is binding on the High Court and not the decision of earlier one
rendered in Micolletta Rohtag/ (supra). In support of the submission,

learned counsel placed reliance on a Division Bench judgment of this Court in

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 6 of 18
MAC Appl. No. 128/2016 (Eunus Alf Vs. Branch Manager, Ba/ja/
Allianz General [nsurance Co. Ltd). The Division bench observed as
under:

“12. The Supreme Court in the case of M.S. Sandhu Vs.
State of Punjab, (2014) 6 SCC 514 has held that in case of
contlict of co-ordinate Benches of equal strength, the latter
decision has to be followed spedally when earlier decision
rendered by co-ordinate Bench has been explained. Similar
view has been taken by a five-/udge Bench of the Madhya
Pradesh High Court in Jabalour Bus Operators Vs. State of
Madhya Pradesh, AlR 2003 (MP) 81 wherein it Is held that in
case of contlict of two Division Benches of equal strength, the
decision of earlier Division Bench shall be followed exceot
when it is explained by the latter Division Bench. In view of
aforesaid enunciation of law and taking into account the
principle of stare decisis, the decision rendered in the cases of
Reshma Kumari and Munna Lal /ain is binding on this Court.”

14. A Full bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court in /aba/pur Bus
Operators Vs. State Of M.P. & Anr. reported A/R 2003 (MP) 81,
confronted with a similar question, that in case of conflicting views between
the decisions rendered by the co-equal Benches of the Apex Court, which

view to be followed by the High Court as a binding precedent, held as under:

“Having considered the matter with broader dimensions, we
find that various High Courts have given different opinion on
the question involved) Some hold that in case of conflict
between two judgments on a point of law, later deasion
should be followed; while others say that the Court should
follow the decision which Is correct and accurate whether it is
earlier or later. There are High Courts which hold that decision
of earlier Bench Is binding because of the theory of binding
precedent and Article 141 of the Constitution of Inala. There
are also deasions which hold that Single Judge differing from
another Single Judge decision should refer the case to Larger
Bench, otherwise he Is bound by it. Deasions which are
rendered without considering the decisions expressing contrary
view have no value as a precedent. But in our considered
opinion, the position may be stated thus
With regard to the High Court, a Single Bench Is bound

by the decision of another Single Bench. In case, he
does not agree with the view of the other Single Bench,

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 7 of 18
he should refer the matter to the Larger Bench.
Similarly, Division Bench Is bound by the judgment of
earlier Division Bench. In case, it does not agree with
the view of the earlier Division Bench, it should refer
the matter to Larger Bench. !n case of conflict between
Juagments of two Division Benches of equal strength,
the decision of earlier Division Bench shall be followed
exceot when it Is explained by the latter Division Bench
In Which case the decision of later Division Bench shall
be binding. The decision of Larger Bench Is binding on
Smaller Benches.

/n case of conflict between two decisions of the Aoex Court,
Benches comprising of egual number of /udges, decision of
earlier Bench is binding unless explained by the latter Bench of
equal strength, in which case the later decision Is binding.
Decision of a Larger Bench Is binding on smaller Benches.
Therefore, the decision of earlier Division Bench, unless
distinguished by latter Division Bench, Is binding on the High
Courts and the Subordinate Courts. Similarly, in presence of
Division Bench decisions and Larger Bench deasions, the
decisions of Larger Bench are binding on the High Courts and
the Subordinate Courts. No decision of Apex Court has been
brought to our notice which holds that in case of conflict
between the two decisions by equal number of /udges, the
later decision in binding in all arcumstances, or the High
Courts and Subordinate Courts can follow any decision which Is
found correct and accurate to the case under consideration.
High Courts and Subordinate Courts should lack cormpetence to
Interoret decisions of Aoex Court since that would not only
defeat what Is envisaged under Article 141 of the Constitution
of Inala but also militate hierarchical suyoremacy of Courts. The
common thread which runs through various decisions of Aoex
Court seems to be that great value has to be attached to
precedent which has taken the shape of rule being followed by
It for the purpose of consistency and exactness in decisions of
Court, unless the Court can Clearly distinguish the decision put
ujo as a precedent or is per incunam, having been rendered
without noticing some earlier precedents with which the Court
agrees. Full Bench decision in Balbir Singh's case (supra) which
holds that if there is conflict of views between the two coequal Benches of the Apex Court, the High Court has to follow
the judgment which appears to it to state the law more
elaborately and more accurately and in conformity with the
scheme of the Act, in our considered opinion, for reasons
recorded in the preceding paragraoh of this judgment, does

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 8 of 18
not lay down the correct law as to application of precedent
and Is, therefore, over-ruled on this point.”

15. Although, with regard to right to file appeal by Insurance Company,
the Apex court in Nico//etta Rohtagi (Supra) expressed somewhat different
view, in the subsequent decision by three Judges Bench in ShAi//la Datta
(Supra), the Apex Court considered and explained the decision of M/co/letta
Rohtagi (supra) in detail and referred certain issues to larger Bench.
However, so far the question with regard to right of Insurance Company to
file appeal taking the ground in addition to Section 149 (2) MV Act, the Apex
Court clearly held that once the insurance company is made a party
respondent, irrespective of obtaining any leave under Section 170 MV Act,
can contest the claim and prefer appeal taking all grounds available to the
insured, besides the statutory defence under Section 149(2) MV Act.

16. In view of the above situation, when the Apex Court in SA//a Datta
(Supra) explained the earlier decision in NMicco/letta Rohtag/ (supra) and
decided the question as indicated above in favour of the insurer, | am of the
view, that in view of the decision of the Division Bench of this Court and also
the principle laid down by the Full Bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court, the
decision rendered by three judges Bench of Apex Court in Shi/la Datta
(Supra) subsequently, is binding on this Court. Be that as it may, while going
through the record of the Tribunal, | find that the Bajaj Allianz General
Insurance Company prayed for leave under Section 170 of the MV Act and
the Tribunal allowed the Insurance Company by order dated 01.06.2012 to
raise all defence, which could be raised by insured in addition to defence
available under Section 149(2). Therefore, the question raised by Mr. Surajit
Dutta challenging the right of the insurance company to prefer appeal, is
redundant, so far the Bajaj Alliance General Insurance Co. Ltd. is concerned.
So far the New India Assurance Co. is concerned, as per Shi/a Datta (supra)
case, the New India Assurance Co. having been impleaded as a party

respondent, obviously has the right to appeal. In that view of the matter, | do

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 9 of 18
not find any force in the submission of the learned counsel Mr. Surajit Dutta

that the appeal filed by the Insurance Companies are not maintainable.

17. Next point raised by Surajit Dutta was that the Bajaj Allianz General
Insurance Company is debarred from raising any defence on the basis of the
policy, in absence of evidence adduced by the Insurance Company inasmuch
as, the policy was not proved by the insurance company. To buttress the
submission, Mr. Dutta placed reliance on a decision of Patna High Court in
Sial Sinha Vs. Shivadhari Sinha & Ors. reported in A/R 1972 Patna 8&1.
There is no denial, that Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company did not file
written statement and for that matter, no evidence was also adduced,

however, it appeared subsequently and contested the case.

18. It transpires from the record, that the policy under which the vehicle
of the deceased was insured has been proved as Ext.10 by the claimant
himself. Since the policy has been proved and brought on evidence, it is
Immaterial who has adduced such evidence and proved the policy. Since
there is evidence on record, both the parties can rely upon such evidence, as
law never preclude any party from relying on the evidence adduced by the
Opposite party. Therefore, there is no bar on the part of the Insurance
Company in replying upon such documentary evidence, though adduced by
the claimant. The insurance policy (Ext.10) transpires that it was a package

policy for private vehicle.

19. Section 147 of the MV Act reads as under:

‘147 Requirements of policies and limits of liability. —
(1) In order to comply with the requirements of this Chapter, a
policy of insurance must be a policy which—
(a) is issued by a person who is an authorised insurer;
and
(fb) insures the person or classes of persons specified in
the policy to the extent specified in sub-section (2)—
(i) against any liability which may be incurred
by him in respect of the death of or bodily 2’
[injury to any person, including owner of the
goods or his authorised representative carried in

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 10 of 18
the vehicle] or damage to any property of a
third party caused by or arising out of the use
of the vehicle in a public place;
(ii) against the death of or bodily injury to any
passenger of a public service vehicle caused by
or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a
public place:
Provided that a policy shall not be required—
(i) to cover liability in respect of the death, arising out
of and in the course of his employment, of the
employee of a person insured by the policy or in
respect of bodily injury sustained by such an employee
arising out of and in the course of his employment
other than a liability arising under the Workmen's
Compensation Act, 1923 (8 of 1923) in respect of the
death of, or bodily injury to, any such employee—
(a) engaged in driving the vehicle, or
(b) if it is a public service vehicle engaged as
conductor of the vehicle or in examining tickets
on the vehicle, or
(c) if it is a goods carriage, being carried in the
vehicle, or
(ii) to cover any contractual liability.
Explanation. —For the removal of doubts, it is hereby
declared that the death of or bodily injury to any
person or damage to any property of a third party shall
be deemed to have been caused by or to have arisen
out of, the use of a vehicle in a public place
notwithstanding that the person who is dead or injured
or the property which is damaged was not in a public
place at the time of the accident, if the act or omission
which led to the accident occurred in a public place.
(2) Subject to the proviso to sub-section (1), a policy of
Insurance referred to in sub-section (1), shall cover any liability
Incurred in respect of any accident, up to the following limits,
namely: —
(a) Save as provided in clause (b), the amount of
liability incurred;
(b) In respect of damage to any property of a third
party, a limit of rupees six thousand:

Provided that any policy of insurance issued with any
limited liability and in force, immediately before the
commencement of this Act, shall continue to be effective for a
period of four months after such commencement or till the
date of expiry of such policy whichever ts earlier.

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 11 of 18
(3) A policy shall be of no effect for the purposes of this
Chapter unless and until there is issued by the insurer in
favour of the person by whom the policy is effected a
certificate of insurance in the prescribed form and containing
the prescribed particulars of any condition subject to which the
policy is issued and of any other prescribed matters; and
different forms, particulars and matters may be prescribed in
different cases.

(4) Where a cover note issued by the insurer under the
provisions of this Chapter or the rules made thereunder is not
followed by a policy of insurance within the prescribed time,
the insurer shall, within seven days of the expiry of the period
of the validity of the cover note, notify the fact to the
registering authority in whose records the vehicle to which the
cover note relates has been registered or to such other
authority as the State Government may prescribe.

(5) Notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time
being in force, an insurer issuing a policy of insurance under
this section shall be liable to indemnify the person or classes of
persons specified in the policy in respect of any liability which
the policy purports to cover in the case of that person or those
classes of persons.”

20. It would appear from the provision of Section 147 MV Act, that under
the policy, liability of Insurance Company is to indemnify the insured owner in
respect of death or injury of any third party, which also necessarily included
certain categories of employees mentioned in Clause (a), (b) and (c) of the
proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 147 MV act. It is also settled position of
law, that there are two types of insurance policy, one Is statutory policy and
the other is contractual policy. Under statutory policy, liability of the
Insurance Company Is limited to what is laid down in Section 147 of the MV
Act. Under Section 147 of the MV Act, Insurance Company has no liability to
pay any compensation in respect of death or injury of the owner/insured
himself, unless there is some contract between the insurer and the insured to
that effect. It is abundantly clear from the provision of Section 147 MV Act
and also Section 163-A or 140 MV Act that the liability to pay compensation

to the victim of motor vehicle accident is basically on the owner of the

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 12 of 18
vehicle, which the insurer is required to indemnify by virtue of the contract of
the policy. The Apex Court in New /ndia Assurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Prabha
Devi & Ors. reported in (2013) 14 SCC 719, the Apex Court dealing with
the liability of the insurer in respect of death or injury of the insured held as

under:

‘8. We have perused the judgment of this Court in the case of
Dhanraj Supra. !n that case, the appellant who was the insurer
was travelling in the insured vehicle which met with an
acadent, In the acadent, the appellant as well as the other
passengers received injuries. A number of Claim petitions carne
to be filed. The appellant who was the insurer also filed a
Caim petition. The MACT held the ariver of the /eeo
responsible for the acadent. /n all the Claim petitions filed by
the other passengers, MACT airected that the appellant (the
owner) as well as the driver and the [Insurance Cormoany were
lable to pay cornpensation. Furthermore, in the Cdaim petition
filed by the appellant, the MACT directed the driver and the
/nsurance Company to pay compensation to the appellant. The
aforesaid finding of the MACT was upheld by the High Court in
the appeal filed by the Insurance Company. The Insurance
Company was, in appeal before this Court challenging the
Judgment of the High Court awarding cornoensation to the
owner of the insured vehicle. Taking into consideration the
provision contained in Section 147 of the Act, this Court
observed as follows :
“8. Thus, an insurance policy covers the lability
Incurred by the insured in respect of death of or bodily
Iryury to any person (including an owner of the goods
or his authorised reoresentative) carried in the vehicle
or damage to any property of a third party caused by
or arising out of the use of the vehicle. Section 147
does not require an insurance company to assume risk
for death or bodily injury to the owner of the vehicle.

9. In the case of Onental Insurance Co. Ltd. versus
Sunita Rathi it has been held that the lability of an
Insurance company Is only for the purpose of
Indermifying the insured against labilities incurred
towards a third person or in respect of darnages to
property. Thus, where the insured |.e. an owner of the
vehicle has no lability to a third party the insurance
company has no lability also.

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 13 of 18
10. In this case, it has not been shown that the policy
covered any risk for injury to the owner himself. We
are unable to acceot the contention that the premium
of Rs.4989 paid under the heading “Own damage’, the
words “oremium on vehicle and non-electrical
accessories” aooear. It Is thus Clear that this premium
Is towards damage to the vehicle and not for injury to
the person of the owner. An owner of a vehicle can
only claim provided a personal acadent insurance has
been taken out. /n this case there Is no such
insurance.”

9. In view of the aforesaid ratio of law, the claim made by the
resoondents could not have been allowed. Consequently, Civil
Appeal No. 479 of 2007 Is allowed. The imougned Award as
well as the imougned judgment of the High Court are set
aside.”

21. The perusal of the policy (Ext.10) shows, that the deceased as owner
of his vehicle, paid an extra premium for personal accident coverage and
therefore, the liability of the insurer in the instant case for death or injury of
the owner, could not be beyond what Is provided in the policy as per contract
between the insurer and insured. Since the deceased himself was the owner
of the vehicle insured with Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd, the Bajaj
Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd is not liable to pay any compensation as
directed by the Tribunal for the simple reason, that as per policy and also as
per the provision of Section 147 of the MV Act, Bajaj Allianz General
Insurance Co. Ltd has no liability for the death or injury of the owner, except,

what is provided in the policy under personal accident coverage.

22. Leaned counsel for both the Insurance Company submitted that while
calculating the loss of dependency, Tribunal deducted 1/3 of the income as
future prospect, whereas, as per the principle laid down in Sarla Verma
(Supra) such deduction for personal expenses ought to have been 1/2 of the
income. The Apex Court in Sar/a Verma (supra) held, that when deceased is
bachelor and claimants are parents, normally 50% of the income is to be
deducted as personal and living expenses. However, where the family of the

bachelor is large and dependent on the income of the deceased, the

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 14 of 18
deduction on personal expenses may be restricted to 1/3 and contribution of
the family shall be treated as 2/3. In the instant case, evidently there is no
other dependent except the mother of the deceased and therefore, as per the
principle laid down in Sar/a Verma (supra), deduction ought to have been
made 50% towards personal expenses of the deceased. What is to be noted
In the instant case is that Tribunal applied multiplier 11, with reference to the
age of the claimant, whereas, it is now settled principle of law, that multiplier
Shall be with reference of the age of the deceased and not with reference to
the age of the parents. Learned Tribunal seems to have fallen in error by
applying multiplier 11, which ought to have been 16 with reference to the
age of the deceased. Had the Tribunal took the proper multiplier 16, in that
case, even after deduction of 50% towards personal expenses, loss of
dependency would have remained almost same. The Apex Court in Ran/ana
Prakash And Ors vs The Divisional Manager And Anr reported in
(2011) 14 SCC 639 observed that irrespective of who files the appeal, the
appropriate course for the High Court is to examine the facts and by applying
the relevant principles, determine the just compensation i.e. award is just and
reasonable. The only embargo put on such obligation of the High Court in
determining just compensation is that in an appeal by insurance company for
reduction of compensation, enhancement of compensation is not permissible
without appeal by the claimant. Taking note of the fact that the Tribunal
wrongly took a lower multiplier, | am not inclined to interfere with the
decision of the Tribunal with regard to deduction towards personal expenses
for the reasons, that had the Tribunal applied proper multiplier, even after
deduction of 50%, loss of dependency would have been almost the same as
has been assessed by the Tribunal after deduction of 1/3 of the income

towards personal expenses.

23. Mr. Sisir Dutta, leaned Sr. Counsel, refereeing to the evidence of CW4 contended that the accident occurred due to rash & negligent driving of the
deceased and therefore, the owner insurer of the truck ought not to have

been held liable. The claimant examined 4 witnesses, out of which, CW-2 was

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 15 of 18
the eye witness, who was travelling in the vehicle with the deceased. The
CW-2 categorically stated that the truck was parked in the middle of the road
without any parking light and for negligent parking of the truck in the middle
of the road, the accident occurred. Accident Information Report, Ext.1 as well
as the charge sheet, Ext. 3 shows that the accident occurred due to fault of
the driver of the truck. CW-4 being police officer, who held preliminary
enquiry of the case, stated categorically that the truck was parked in the
middle of the road. However, he further stated that there were 12 fts. space
on the side of the divider and according to him, had the driver of the Santro
car drove the vehicle in a moderate speed, accident could have been avoided.
This part of the statement of CW-4 appears to be his opinion, whch does not
carry any evidentiary value. Apparently, CW-4 was not an eye witness and as
such he had no personal knowledge as to how the vehicle was driven or how
the accident occurred. But the categorical evidence of the eye witness, CW-2
that the truck was parked in the middle of the road without any back light,
because of which the accident occurred, supported by the documentary
evidence being the charge sheet, left no room for any speculation as to who

was at fault for the accident.

24. However, considering the facts and circumstances of the case and the
totality of the evidence, learned Tribunal in its wisdom apportioned the
liability attributing same amount of contributory negligence to the deceased, |
do not find any fault with such finding of the Tribunal in apportioning the
liability fixing 40% contributory negligence on the deceased, inasmuch as, the
claimant or the insurer of the Santro car has not challenged the finding of the

Tribunal with regard to apportionment of the liability.

25. The next point raised by learned Sr. Counsel Mr. S. Dutta is that while
assessing the income, the Tribunal did not deduct income tax. Referring to
the decision of the Apex Court in Sarfa Verma (supra), learned counsel
submits that only net income or the ‘take home pay’ after deduction of tax is

required to be taken into consideration for purpose of assessing loss of

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 16 of 18
dependency. The claimant has stated that salary of the deceased, who was a
Mechanical Engineer was Rs. 38,438/- and proved a salary certificate issued
by his employer as Ext.11. The author of the Ext.11 was also examined, but
during cross examination of the author of the Ext.11, no question was put to
the author of the certificate, whether the amount of salary mentioned in Ext.1
was the ‘take home pay’ after deducting tax etc. or not. The insurance
company has also not adduced any evidence that the salary shown in the
Ext.11 and also deposed by the claimant was not the net pay after deducting
Income tax. |n absence of such evidence, | am of the view that no deduction
towards income tax could be made. Another point raised by Mr. S. Dutta
referring to the cross examination of CW-1, that deceased used to send Rs.
7000/- to her every month by Money Order. Learned counsel Mr. S. Dutta
contended that this Rs. 7000/- was the only contribution to the family and
therefore loss of dependency ought to have been assessed on the basis of
the said contribution of Rs. 7000/- per month only. | do not find any force in
this submission of the learned counsel, for the simple reason, that only
because the deceased used to send Rs. 7000/- per month by Money Order
that itself would not necessarily mean, that the deceased was not looking

after his parents or did not contribute to the family.

26. In view of the forgoing discussions, | am of the view that the
compensation determined by the Tribunal in the instant case warrant no
interference. However, since the deceased also contributed to the accident to
the extent of 40% as decided by the Tribunal, the claimant cannot get any
compensation for the wrong done by deceased himself and therefore, the
claimant shall be entitled only to 60% of the compensation determined by the
Tribunal to be satisfied by the New India Assurance Co. Ltd.. The accident
having taken place due to contributory negligence of the deceased, who was
owner of the vehicle insured with Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd.,
Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd. cannot be saddled with the
responsibility to satisfy the 40% of the award as directed by the Tribunal, as

one cannot get compensation for his own fault in claim under Section 166 MV

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 17 of 18
Mkk

Act. That apart, deceased not being third party, so far Bajaj Allianz | nsurance
Co. is concerned, the insurer of the deceased/owner is not liable to pay

compensation for the death of the owner/insured.

2/. With the above modification in the award with regard to liability of the
appellant Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd, the appeal filed by Bajaj
Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd is allowed and the appeal filed New India
Assurance Co. Ltd. is dismissed.

1. Advocate
Mr. R. Goswami, Advocate

For the Respondents: Mr. SUrajit Dutta, Advocate
BEFORE
THE HON’BLE MR. Brief facts, which led to the present appeals are that on 31.03.2010,
Late Dipankar Kakati was travelling in a car bearing registration No. (i) The deceased was owner of the car and the accident having taken
place for negligence of the deceased himself, the insurer of the car
was not liable to pay any compensation, as under the policy, liability
of the Insurance Company was to indemnify the insured in respect of
claim of third party only. Delhi Transport Corp. reported in (2009) 6 SCC 121;

MAC App. 272/2014 raised the following points:

(i) While assessing loss of dependency, learned Tribunal did not
deduct the professional tax and income tax from the gross
income of the deceased. As per Section 147 of the
MV Act, liability of the Insurance Company is to indemnify the insured, for any
claim against the owner, in respect of death or injury of a third party. Learned
counsel also submitted that the Tribunal ought to have deducted 50% of the
Income while assessing the loss of dependency, considering the fact, that the
claim petition was by mother for the death of son and there was no other
dependents, but deduction of 1/3 in the instant case was improper as the
deceased left no other dependent except the parents and claim petition was filed

by his mother. Mr. Surajit Dutta
also contended that although in a subsequent decision of United /ndta
/nsurance Co. Ltd. Vs. However, by virtue of Section 170 of the 1988 Act, where in
course of an enguiry the Claims Tribunal Is satisfied that (a )
there Is a collusion between the person making a Claim and
the person against whom the Claim has been made or (b) the
person against whom the Caim has been made has failed to
contest the claim, the tribunal may, for reasons to be recorded
in writing, impolead the insurer and in that case it 1s permissible
for the insurer to contest the claim also on the grounds which
are available to the insured or to the person against whom the
Claim has been made. Thus where conaitions precedent embodied in Section 170 Is

MAC App. What
therefore follows from S/A//a Datta (supra) is that, when the insurance
company is made party even by the claimant, it can contest the claim raising
all defence available to insured and the question of obtaining leave as

contemplated in Section 170 MV Act becomes redundtant. Mr. Surajit Dutta placing reliance on the decision of the Apex Court in
Sundip Kumar Batna Vs. 272/2014 Page 5 of 18
former decision is binding and not the decision rendered subsequently by coequal Bench. Mr. Surajit Dutta, in support of his submission placed reliance

on paragraph - 17 of the judgment, which is reproduced below:

“17. The Constitution Bench in Union of India vs Raghubir
Singh, 1989 (2) SCC 754, has come to the condusion

of the law pronounced by a Division Bench in relation to a case
raising the same point subsequently before a Division Bench of
a smaller number of Judges? There is no constitutional or
statutory prescription in the matter, and the point is governed
entirely by the practice in India of the courts sanctified by

Pradesh High Court in Jabalour Bus Operators Vs. State of
Madhya Pradesh, AlR 2003 (MP) 81 wherein it Is held that in
case of contlict of two Division Benches of equal strength, the
decision of earlier Division Bench shall be followed exceot
when it is explained by the latter Division Bench. A Full bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court in /aba/pur Bus
Operators Vs. There are High Courts which hold that decision
of earlier Bench Is binding because of the theory of binding
precedent and Article 141 of the Constitution of Inala. In case, he
does not agree with the view of the other Single Bench,

MAC App. Similarly, Division Bench Is bound by the judgment of
earlier Division Bench. In case, it does not agree with
the view of the earlier Division Bench, it should refer
the matter to Larger Bench. ! n case of conflict between
Juagments of two Division Benches of equal strength,
the decision of earlier Division Bench shall be followed
exceot when it Is explained by the latter Division Bench
In Which case the decision of later Division Bench shall
be binding. Therefore, the decision of earlier Division Bench, unless
distinguished by latter Division Bench, Is binding on the High
Courts and the Subordinate Courts. The
common thread which runs through various decisions of Aoex
Court seems to be that great value has to be attached to
precedent which has taken the shape of rule being followed by
It for the purpose of consistency and exactness in decisions of
Court, unless the Court can Clearly distinguish the decision put
ujo as a precedent or is per incunam, having been rendered
without noticing some earlier precedents with which the Court
agrees. In view of the above situation, when the Apex Court in SA//a Datta
(Supra) explained the earlier decision in NMicco/letta Rohtag/ (supra) and
decided the question as indicated above in favour of the insurer, | am of the
view, that in view of the decision of the Division Bench of this Court and also
the principle laid down by the Full Bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court, the
decision rendered by three judges Bench of Apex Court in Shi/la Datta
(Supra) subsequently, is binding on this Court. Next point raised by Surajit Dutta was that the Bajaj Allianz General
Insurance Company is debarred from raising any defence on the basis of the
policy, in absence of evidence adduced by the Insurance Company inasmuch
as, the policy was not proved by the insurance company. To buttress the
submission, Mr. Dutta placed reliance on a decision of Patna High Court in
Sial Sinha Vs. It transpires from the record, that the policy under which the vehicle
of the deceased was insured has been proved as Ext.10 by the claimant
himself. Since the policy has been proved and brought on evidence, it is
Immaterial who has adduced such evidence and proved the policy. Since
there is evidence on record, both the parties can rely upon such evidence, as
law never preclude any party from relying on the evidence adduced by the
Opposite party. Therefore, there is no bar on the part of the Insurance
Company in replying upon such documentary evidence, though adduced by
the claimant. The insurance policy (Ext.10) transpires that it was a package

policy for private vehicle. Section 147 of the MV Act reads as under:

‘147 Requirements of policies and limits of liability. — (1) In order to comply with the requirements of this Chapter, a
policy of insurance must be a policy which—
(a) is issued by a person who is an authorised insurer;

vehicle, which the insurer is required to indemnify by virtue of the contract of
the policy. reported in (2013) 14 SCC 719, the Apex Court dealing with
the liability of the insurer in respect of death or injury of the insured held as

under:

‘8. The MACT held the ariver of the /eeo
responsible for the acadent. Furthermore, in the Cdaim petition
filed by the appellant, the MACT directed the driver and the
/nsurance Company to pay compensation to the appellant. Taking into consideration the
provision contained in Section 147 of the Act, this Court
observed as follows :
“8. Section 147
does not require an insurance company to assume risk
for death or bodily injury to the owner of the vehicle. an owner of the
vehicle has no lability to a third party the insurance
company has no lability also. In this case, it has not been shown that the policy
covered any risk for injury to the owner himself. It Is thus Clear that this premium
Is towards damage to the vehicle and not for injury to
the person of the owner. In view of the aforesaid ratio of law, the claim made by the
resoondents could not have been allowed. The imougned Award as
well as the imougned judgment of the High Court are set
aside.” However, where the family of the

bachelor is large and dependent on the income of the deceased, the

MAC App. The claimant examined 4 witnesses, out of which, CW-2 was

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 15 of 18
the eye witness, who was travelling in the vehicle with the deceased. The
CW-2 categorically stated that the truck was parked in the middle of the road
without any parking light and for negligent parking of the truck in the middle
of the road, the accident occurred. Accident Information Report, Ext.1 as well
as the charge sheet, Ext. 3 shows that the accident occurred due to fault of
the driver of the truck. Apparently, CW-4 was not an eye witness and as
such he had no personal knowledge as to how the vehicle was driven or how
the accident occurred. The claimant has stated that salary of the deceased, who was a
Mechanical Engineer was Rs. 7000/- was the only contribution to the family and
therefore loss of dependency ought to have been assessed on the basis of
the said contribution of Rs. | do not find any force in
this submission of the learned counsel, for the simple reason, that only
because the deceased used to send Rs. 2/. With the above modification in the award with regard to liability of the
appellant Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd, the appeal filed by Bajaj
Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd is allowed and the appeal filed New India
Assurance Co. Ltd. is dismissed. 272/2014 Page 18 of 18

Date of hearing : 03.08.2017

JUDGMENT & ORDER

These two appeals are filed by New India Assurance Co. Ltd. and
Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd., respectively, challenging the
judgment and award dated 12.07.2013 passed by MACT, Tinsukia in Mac
Case No. 29/2011.

MAC Appl. 272/2014 Page 1 of 18
2. Brief facts, which led to the present appeals are that on 31.03.2010,
Late Dipankar Kakati was travelling in a car bearing registration No. As-23/F1209 from Guwahati to Digboi. The car was driven by Late Dipankar Kakati,
who was the owner of the vehicle. The said car driven by deceased Dipankar
Kakati met with an accident after hitting against a standing truck, which was
parked on the middle of road without any parking light or indicator. As a
result of the accident, he sustained injuries and died. The parents of Late
Dipankar Kakati filed a claim petition before the MACT, Tinsukia, and the
learned Tribunal passed an award of Rs. 30,86,289/- with interest @ 6%. The
learned Tribunal apportioned the liability attributing contributory negligence
to the deceased to the extent of 40%. The vehicle owned and driven by
deceased was insured with the appellant Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co.
Ltd. and the truck involved in the accident was insured with New India
Assurance Co. Ltd.

3. Aggrieved by the judgment and award, both the Insurance Companies

have preferred the respective appeals.

4. The Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd., appellant in MAC Appl.
221/2015 raised the following points in its appeal No. 221/2015.

(i) The deceased was owner of the car and the accident having taken
place for negligence of the deceased himself, the insurer of the car
was not liable to pay any compensation, as under the policy, liability
of the Insurance Company was to indemnify the insured in respect of
claim of third party only. The deceased being owner and diver of the
vehicle, insured with Bajaj Alianz General Insurnce Co. Ltd., Tribunal
ought not to have held the insurer of the deceased, responsible for
satisfying 40% of the award.

(il) The Tribunal wrongly deducted 1/3 of the income towards personal
expenses, which as per the principle laid down in Sarala Verma
(Smt.) Vs. Delhi Transport Corp. reported in (2009) 6 SCC 121;

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 2 of 18
ought to have been 1/2 of the income, as the claim petition was filed

by mother, for death of her son.

5. The appellant in MAC Appl. 272/2014 raised the following points:

(i) While assessing loss of dependency, learned Tribunal did not
deduct the professional tax and income tax from the gross
income of the deceased.

(ii) Assessment of dependency was wrong.

(ili) © The accident occurred due to the fault of the deceased himself
and therefore, insurer of the standing truck ought not to have
been saddled with the liability to satisfy the award

(iv) | The claimant being parents, the Tribunal ought not to have

granted consortium.

6. Learned Sr. Counsel, Mr. S. Dutta for the New India Assurance Co.
Ltd., learned counsel Mr. R. Goswami for the Bajaj Allianz General Insurance
Co. Ltd. and learned counsel Mr. Surajit Dutta for the respondents were

heard at length.

7. Leaned counsel Mr. R. Goswami, contended that as per the policy, the
Insurer of the vehicle, owned by the deceased was not liable to pay any
compensation, as the deceased was not a third party. As per Section 147 of the
MV Act, liability of the Insurance Company is to indemnify the insured, for any
claim against the owner, in respect of death or injury of a third party. Learned
counsel also submitted that the Tribunal ought to have deducted 50% of the
Income while assessing the loss of dependency, considering the fact, that the
claim petition was by mother for the death of son and there was no other
dependents, but deduction of 1/3 in the instant case was improper as the
deceased left no other dependent except the parents and claim petition was filed

by his mother.

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 3 of 18
8. Mr. Surajit Dutta, learned counsel for the respondent/claimant
vehemently arguing on the locus of both the Insurance Co. to prefer appeal,
contended that the case was proceeded ex-parte against the Bajaj Allianz
General Insurance Company before the Tribunal and therefore, the said
company has no right to file appeal. Further contention of the learned
counsel was that the New India Assurance Co. having not obtained leave
under Section 170 MV Act is also not entitled to challenge the quantum of
award in appeal. In support of his submission, learned counsel placed
reliance on the decision of the Apex Court in National /[nsurance Co. Ltd.
Vs. Nicolletta Rohtagi, reported in (2002) 7 SCC 456. Mr. Surajit Dutta
also contended that although in a subsequent decision of United /ndta
/nsurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Shila Datta reported in (2011) 10 SCC 509, a
contrary view was taken by the Apex Court, the decision of Nico/letta

(Supra) being earlier in point of time is binding.

9. The Apex Court in Mico//etta Rahtog/ (supra) dealing with the right
of the insurance company to prefer appeal on merit of the claim and quantum

of compensation observed as under:

‘For the aforesaid reasons, an insurer If aggrieved against an
award, may file an appeal only on those grounds and no other.
However, by virtue of Section 170 of the 1988 Act, where in
course of an enguiry the Claims Tribunal Is satisfied that (a )
there Is a collusion between the person making a Claim and
the person against whom the Claim has been made or (b) the
person against whom the Caim has been made has failed to
contest the claim, the tribunal may, for reasons to be recorded
in writing, impolead the insurer and in that case it 1s permissible
for the insurer to contest the claim also on the grounds which
are available to the insured or to the person against whom the
Claim has been made. Thus, unless an order Is passed by the
tribunal permitting the insurer to avail the grounds available to
an insured or any other person against whom a Claim has been
made on being satisfied of the two conalitions soecitied in
Section 170 of the Act, it is not permissible to the insurer to
contest the daim on the grounds which are available to the
Insured or to a person against whom a claim has been made.
Thus where conaitions precedent embodied in Section 170 Is

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 4 of 18
satistied and award Is adverse to the interest of the insurer,
the insurer has a noht to file an appeal challenging the
guantum of compensation or negligence or contributory
negligence of the offending vehicle even if the insured has not
filed any appeal against the quantum of compensation.
Sections 149, 170 and 173 are part of one Scheme and if we
give any different interpretation to Section 173 of the 1988
Act, the same would go contrary to the scheme and object of
the Act.”

10. A three Judges Bench of the Apex Court in Shi/a Datta (supra)
answering the question whether insurer can contest a motor accident claim
on merit in regard to the quantum in addition to the ground mentioned in
Section 149(2) of the Act for avoiding liability under the policy of insurance
held as under:

‘Therefore, where the insurer is a party- respondent, either on
account of being impleaded as a party by the tribunal under
section 170 or being impleaded as a party-respondent by the
claimants in the claim petition voluntarily, it will be entitled to
contest the matter by raising all grounds, without being
restricted to the grounds available under section 149(2) of the
Act. The claim petition is maintainable against the owner and
driver without impleading the insurer as a party”

11. As per Shila Datta (supra) case, once the insurance company Is
made party respondent, irrespective of the fact, whether it is made party by
the claimant or by the Tribunal under Section 170 MV Act, it can raise all
grounds including the grounds, which are available to the insured. What
therefore follows from S/A//a Datta (supra) is that, when the insurance
company is made party even by the claimant, it can contest the claim raising
all defence available to insured and the question of obtaining leave as

contemplated in Section 170 MV Act becomes redundtant.

12. Mr. Surajit Dutta placing reliance on the decision of the Apex Court in
Sundip Kumar Batna Vs. State of Maharashtra reported in (2014) 16
SCC 623 submitted that when the co-equal Benches of equal strength of

judges of the Apex court are divergence of views, the view taken in the

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 5 of 18
former decision is binding and not the decision rendered subsequently by coequal Bench. Mr. Surajit Dutta, in support of his submission placed reliance

on paragraph - 17 of the judgment, which is reproduced below:

“17. The Constitution Bench in Union of India vs Raghubir
Singh, 1989 (2) SCC 754, has come to the condusion
extracted below:

‘27. What then should be the position in regard to the effect
of the law pronounced by a Division Bench in relation to a case
raising the same point subsequently before a Division Bench of
a smaller number of Judges? There is no constitutional or
statutory prescription in the matter, and the point is governed
entirely by the practice in India of the courts sanctified by
reoeated affirmation over a century of time. /t cannot be
doubted that in order to promote consistency and certainty in
the law laid down by a superior Court, the ideal conoaition
would be that the entire Court should sit in all cases to decide
questions of law, and for that reason the Supreme Court of the
United States does so. But having regard to the volurne of
work demanding the attention of the Court, it has been found
necessary in India as a general rule of practice and
convenience that the Court should sit in Divisions, each
Division being constituted of /udges whose number may be
determined by the exigencies of judicdal need, by the nature of
the case including any statutory mandate relative thereto, and
by such other considerations which the Chief /ustice, in whom
such authority devolves by convention, may find most
aooroonate. It is in order to guard against the possibility of
Inconsistent decisions on points of law by different Division
Benches that the Rule has been evolved, in order to promote
consistency and certainty in the develooment of the law and
its contemporary status, that the statement of the law by a
Division Bench Is considered binding on a Division Bench of the
same or lesser number of Judges. This prinaple has been
followed in Inala by several generations of / udges. ...”

13. Countering the above submission, learned Sr. Counsel Mr. Sisir Dutta
contended that the decision rendered in ShA//a Datta (supra) by a three
judge Bench is binding on the High Court and not the decision of earlier one
rendered in Micolletta Rohtag/ (supra). In support of the submission,

learned counsel placed reliance on a Division Bench judgment of this Court in

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 6 of 18
MAC Appl. No. 128/2016 (Eunus Alf Vs. Branch Manager, Ba/ja/
Allianz General [nsurance Co. Ltd). The Division bench observed as
under:

“12. The Supreme Court in the case of M.S. Sandhu Vs.
State of Punjab, (2014) 6 SCC 514 has held that in case of
contlict of co-ordinate Benches of equal strength, the latter
decision has to be followed spedally when earlier decision
rendered by co-ordinate Bench has been explained. Similar
view has been taken by a five-/udge Bench of the Madhya
Pradesh High Court in Jabalour Bus Operators Vs. State of
Madhya Pradesh, AlR 2003 (MP) 81 wherein it Is held that in
case of contlict of two Division Benches of equal strength, the
decision of earlier Division Bench shall be followed exceot
when it is explained by the latter Division Bench. In view of
aforesaid enunciation of law and taking into account the
principle of stare decisis, the decision rendered in the cases of
Reshma Kumari and Munna Lal /ain is binding on this Court.”

14. A Full bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court in /aba/pur Bus
Operators Vs. State Of M.P. & Anr. reported A/R 2003 (MP) 81,
confronted with a similar question, that in case of conflicting views between
the decisions rendered by the co-equal Benches of the Apex Court, which

view to be followed by the High Court as a binding precedent, held as under:

“Having considered the matter with broader dimensions, we
find that various High Courts have given different opinion on
the question involved) Some hold that in case of conflict
between two judgments on a point of law, later deasion
should be followed; while others say that the Court should
follow the decision which Is correct and accurate whether it is
earlier or later. There are High Courts which hold that decision
of earlier Bench Is binding because of the theory of binding
precedent and Article 141 of the Constitution of Inala. There
are also deasions which hold that Single Judge differing from
another Single Judge decision should refer the case to Larger
Bench, otherwise he Is bound by it. Deasions which are
rendered without considering the decisions expressing contrary
view have no value as a precedent. But in our considered
opinion, the position may be stated thus
With regard to the High Court, a Single Bench Is bound

by the decision of another Single Bench. In case, he
does not agree with the view of the other Single Bench,

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 7 of 18
he should refer the matter to the Larger Bench.
Similarly, Division Bench Is bound by the judgment of
earlier Division Bench. In case, it does not agree with
the view of the earlier Division Bench, it should refer
the matter to Larger Bench. !n case of conflict between
Juagments of two Division Benches of equal strength,
the decision of earlier Division Bench shall be followed
exceot when it Is explained by the latter Division Bench
In Which case the decision of later Division Bench shall
be binding. The decision of Larger Bench Is binding on
Smaller Benches.

/n case of conflict between two decisions of the Aoex Court,
Benches comprising of egual number of /udges, decision of
earlier Bench is binding unless explained by the latter Bench of
equal strength, in which case the later decision Is binding.
Decision of a Larger Bench Is binding on smaller Benches.
Therefore, the decision of earlier Division Bench, unless
distinguished by latter Division Bench, Is binding on the High
Courts and the Subordinate Courts. Similarly, in presence of
Division Bench decisions and Larger Bench deasions, the
decisions of Larger Bench are binding on the High Courts and
the Subordinate Courts. No decision of Apex Court has been
brought to our notice which holds that in case of conflict
between the two decisions by equal number of /udges, the
later decision in binding in all arcumstances, or the High
Courts and Subordinate Courts can follow any decision which Is
found correct and accurate to the case under consideration.
High Courts and Subordinate Courts should lack cormpetence to
Interoret decisions of Aoex Court since that would not only
defeat what Is envisaged under Article 141 of the Constitution
of Inala but also militate hierarchical suyoremacy of Courts. The
common thread which runs through various decisions of Aoex
Court seems to be that great value has to be attached to
precedent which has taken the shape of rule being followed by
It for the purpose of consistency and exactness in decisions of
Court, unless the Court can Clearly distinguish the decision put
ujo as a precedent or is per incunam, having been rendered
without noticing some earlier precedents with which the Court
agrees. Full Bench decision in Balbir Singh's case (supra) which
holds that if there is conflict of views between the two coequal Benches of the Apex Court, the High Court has to follow
the judgment which appears to it to state the law more
elaborately and more accurately and in conformity with the
scheme of the Act, in our considered opinion, for reasons
recorded in the preceding paragraoh of this judgment, does

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 8 of 18
not lay down the correct law as to application of precedent
and Is, therefore, over-ruled on this point.”

15. Although, with regard to right to file appeal by Insurance Company,
the Apex court in Nico//etta Rohtagi (Supra) expressed somewhat different
view, in the subsequent decision by three Judges Bench in ShAi//la Datta
(Supra), the Apex Court considered and explained the decision of M/co/letta
Rohtagi (supra) in detail and referred certain issues to larger Bench.
However, so far the question with regard to right of Insurance Company to
file appeal taking the ground in addition to Section 149 (2) MV Act, the Apex
Court clearly held that once the insurance company is made a party
respondent, irrespective of obtaining any leave under Section 170 MV Act,
can contest the claim and prefer appeal taking all grounds available to the
insured, besides the statutory defence under Section 149(2) MV Act.

16. In view of the above situation, when the Apex Court in SA//a Datta
(Supra) explained the earlier decision in NMicco/letta Rohtag/ (supra) and
decided the question as indicated above in favour of the insurer, | am of the
view, that in view of the decision of the Division Bench of this Court and also
the principle laid down by the Full Bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court, the
decision rendered by three judges Bench of Apex Court in Shi/la Datta
(Supra) subsequently, is binding on this Court. Be that as it may, while going
through the record of the Tribunal, | find that the Bajaj Allianz General
Insurance Company prayed for leave under Section 170 of the MV Act and
the Tribunal allowed the Insurance Company by order dated 01.06.2012 to
raise all defence, which could be raised by insured in addition to defence
available under Section 149(2). Therefore, the question raised by Mr. Surajit
Dutta challenging the right of the insurance company to prefer appeal, is
redundant, so far the Bajaj Alliance General Insurance Co. Ltd. is concerned.
So far the New India Assurance Co. is concerned, as per Shi/a Datta (supra)
case, the New India Assurance Co. having been impleaded as a party

respondent, obviously has the right to appeal. In that view of the matter, | do

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 9 of 18
not find any force in the submission of the learned counsel Mr. Surajit Dutta

that the appeal filed by the Insurance Companies are not maintainable.

17. Next point raised by Surajit Dutta was that the Bajaj Allianz General
Insurance Company is debarred from raising any defence on the basis of the
policy, in absence of evidence adduced by the Insurance Company inasmuch
as, the policy was not proved by the insurance company. To buttress the
submission, Mr. Dutta placed reliance on a decision of Patna High Court in
Sial Sinha Vs. Shivadhari Sinha & Ors. reported in A/R 1972 Patna 8&1.
There is no denial, that Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company did not file
written statement and for that matter, no evidence was also adduced,

however, it appeared subsequently and contested the case.

18. It transpires from the record, that the policy under which the vehicle
of the deceased was insured has been proved as Ext.10 by the claimant
himself. Since the policy has been proved and brought on evidence, it is
Immaterial who has adduced such evidence and proved the policy. Since
there is evidence on record, both the parties can rely upon such evidence, as
law never preclude any party from relying on the evidence adduced by the
Opposite party. Therefore, there is no bar on the part of the Insurance
Company in replying upon such documentary evidence, though adduced by
the claimant. The insurance policy (Ext.10) transpires that it was a package

policy for private vehicle.

19. Section 147 of the MV Act reads as under:

‘147 Requirements of policies and limits of liability. —
(1) In order to comply with the requirements of this Chapter, a
policy of insurance must be a policy which—
(a) is issued by a person who is an authorised insurer;
and
(fb) insures the person or classes of persons specified in
the policy to the extent specified in sub-section (2)—
(i) against any liability which may be incurred
by him in respect of the death of or bodily 2’
[injury to any person, including owner of the
goods or his authorised representative carried in

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 10 of 18
the vehicle] or damage to any property of a
third party caused by or arising out of the use
of the vehicle in a public place;
(ii) against the death of or bodily injury to any
passenger of a public service vehicle caused by
or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a
public place:
Provided that a policy shall not be required—
(i) to cover liability in respect of the death, arising out
of and in the course of his employment, of the
employee of a person insured by the policy or in
respect of bodily injury sustained by such an employee
arising out of and in the course of his employment
other than a liability arising under the Workmen's
Compensation Act, 1923 (8 of 1923) in respect of the
death of, or bodily injury to, any such employee—
(a) engaged in driving the vehicle, or
(b) if it is a public service vehicle engaged as
conductor of the vehicle or in examining tickets
on the vehicle, or
(c) if it is a goods carriage, being carried in the
vehicle, or
(ii) to cover any contractual liability.
Explanation. —For the removal of doubts, it is hereby
declared that the death of or bodily injury to any
person or damage to any property of a third party shall
be deemed to have been caused by or to have arisen
out of, the use of a vehicle in a public place
notwithstanding that the person who is dead or injured
or the property which is damaged was not in a public
place at the time of the accident, if the act or omission
which led to the accident occurred in a public place.
(2) Subject to the proviso to sub-section (1), a policy of
Insurance referred to in sub-section (1), shall cover any liability
Incurred in respect of any accident, up to the following limits,
namely: —
(a) Save as provided in clause (b), the amount of
liability incurred;
(b) In respect of damage to any property of a third
party, a limit of rupees six thousand:

Provided that any policy of insurance issued with any
limited liability and in force, immediately before the
commencement of this Act, shall continue to be effective for a
period of four months after such commencement or till the
date of expiry of such policy whichever ts earlier.

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 11 of 18
(3) A policy shall be of no effect for the purposes of this
Chapter unless and until there is issued by the insurer in
favour of the person by whom the policy is effected a
certificate of insurance in the prescribed form and containing
the prescribed particulars of any condition subject to which the
policy is issued and of any other prescribed matters; and
different forms, particulars and matters may be prescribed in
different cases.

(4) Where a cover note issued by the insurer under the
provisions of this Chapter or the rules made thereunder is not
followed by a policy of insurance within the prescribed time,
the insurer shall, within seven days of the expiry of the period
of the validity of the cover note, notify the fact to the
registering authority in whose records the vehicle to which the
cover note relates has been registered or to such other
authority as the State Government may prescribe.

(5) Notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time
being in force, an insurer issuing a policy of insurance under
this section shall be liable to indemnify the person or classes of
persons specified in the policy in respect of any liability which
the policy purports to cover in the case of that person or those
classes of persons.”

20. It would appear from the provision of Section 147 MV Act, that under
the policy, liability of Insurance Company is to indemnify the insured owner in
respect of death or injury of any third party, which also necessarily included
certain categories of employees mentioned in Clause (a), (b) and (c) of the
proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 147 MV act. It is also settled position of
law, that there are two types of insurance policy, one Is statutory policy and
the other is contractual policy. Under statutory policy, liability of the
Insurance Company Is limited to what is laid down in Section 147 of the MV
Act. Under Section 147 of the MV Act, Insurance Company has no liability to
pay any compensation in respect of death or injury of the owner/insured
himself, unless there is some contract between the insurer and the insured to
that effect. It is abundantly clear from the provision of Section 147 MV Act
and also Section 163-A or 140 MV Act that the liability to pay compensation

to the victim of motor vehicle accident is basically on the owner of the

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 12 of 18
vehicle, which the insurer is required to indemnify by virtue of the contract of
the policy. The Apex Court in New /ndia Assurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Prabha
Devi & Ors. reported in (2013) 14 SCC 719, the Apex Court dealing with
the liability of the insurer in respect of death or injury of the insured held as

under:

‘8. We have perused the judgment of this Court in the case of
Dhanraj Supra. !n that case, the appellant who was the insurer
was travelling in the insured vehicle which met with an
acadent, In the acadent, the appellant as well as the other
passengers received injuries. A number of Claim petitions carne
to be filed. The appellant who was the insurer also filed a
Caim petition. The MACT held the ariver of the /eeo
responsible for the acadent. /n all the Claim petitions filed by
the other passengers, MACT airected that the appellant (the
owner) as well as the driver and the [Insurance Cormoany were
lable to pay cornpensation. Furthermore, in the Cdaim petition
filed by the appellant, the MACT directed the driver and the
/nsurance Company to pay compensation to the appellant. The
aforesaid finding of the MACT was upheld by the High Court in
the appeal filed by the Insurance Company. The Insurance
Company was, in appeal before this Court challenging the
Judgment of the High Court awarding cornoensation to the
owner of the insured vehicle. Taking into consideration the
provision contained in Section 147 of the Act, this Court
observed as follows :
“8. Thus, an insurance policy covers the lability
Incurred by the insured in respect of death of or bodily
Iryury to any person (including an owner of the goods
or his authorised reoresentative) carried in the vehicle
or damage to any property of a third party caused by
or arising out of the use of the vehicle. Section 147
does not require an insurance company to assume risk
for death or bodily injury to the owner of the vehicle.

9. In the case of Onental Insurance Co. Ltd. versus
Sunita Rathi it has been held that the lability of an
Insurance company Is only for the purpose of
Indermifying the insured against labilities incurred
towards a third person or in respect of darnages to
property. Thus, where the insured |.e. an owner of the
vehicle has no lability to a third party the insurance
company has no lability also.

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 13 of 18
10. In this case, it has not been shown that the policy
covered any risk for injury to the owner himself. We
are unable to acceot the contention that the premium
of Rs.4989 paid under the heading “Own damage’, the
words “oremium on vehicle and non-electrical
accessories” aooear. It Is thus Clear that this premium
Is towards damage to the vehicle and not for injury to
the person of the owner. An owner of a vehicle can
only claim provided a personal acadent insurance has
been taken out. /n this case there Is no such
insurance.”

9. In view of the aforesaid ratio of law, the claim made by the
resoondents could not have been allowed. Consequently, Civil
Appeal No. 479 of 2007 Is allowed. The imougned Award as
well as the imougned judgment of the High Court are set
aside.”

21. The perusal of the policy (Ext.10) shows, that the deceased as owner
of his vehicle, paid an extra premium for personal accident coverage and
therefore, the liability of the insurer in the instant case for death or injury of
the owner, could not be beyond what Is provided in the policy as per contract
between the insurer and insured. Since the deceased himself was the owner
of the vehicle insured with Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd, the Bajaj
Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd is not liable to pay any compensation as
directed by the Tribunal for the simple reason, that as per policy and also as
per the provision of Section 147 of the MV Act, Bajaj Allianz General
Insurance Co. Ltd has no liability for the death or injury of the owner, except,

what is provided in the policy under personal accident coverage.

22. Leaned counsel for both the Insurance Company submitted that while
calculating the loss of dependency, Tribunal deducted 1/3 of the income as
future prospect, whereas, as per the principle laid down in Sarla Verma
(Supra) such deduction for personal expenses ought to have been 1/2 of the
income. The Apex Court in Sar/a Verma (supra) held, that when deceased is
bachelor and claimants are parents, normally 50% of the income is to be
deducted as personal and living expenses. However, where the family of the

bachelor is large and dependent on the income of the deceased, the

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 14 of 18
deduction on personal expenses may be restricted to 1/3 and contribution of
the family shall be treated as 2/3. In the instant case, evidently there is no
other dependent except the mother of the deceased and therefore, as per the
principle laid down in Sar/a Verma (supra), deduction ought to have been
made 50% towards personal expenses of the deceased. What is to be noted
In the instant case is that Tribunal applied multiplier 11, with reference to the
age of the claimant, whereas, it is now settled principle of law, that multiplier
Shall be with reference of the age of the deceased and not with reference to
the age of the parents. Learned Tribunal seems to have fallen in error by
applying multiplier 11, which ought to have been 16 with reference to the
age of the deceased. Had the Tribunal took the proper multiplier 16, in that
case, even after deduction of 50% towards personal expenses, loss of
dependency would have remained almost same. The Apex Court in Ran/ana
Prakash And Ors vs The Divisional Manager And Anr reported in
(2011) 14 SCC 639 observed that irrespective of who files the appeal, the
appropriate course for the High Court is to examine the facts and by applying
the relevant principles, determine the just compensation i.e. award is just and
reasonable. The only embargo put on such obligation of the High Court in
determining just compensation is that in an appeal by insurance company for
reduction of compensation, enhancement of compensation is not permissible
without appeal by the claimant. Taking note of the fact that the Tribunal
wrongly took a lower multiplier, | am not inclined to interfere with the
decision of the Tribunal with regard to deduction towards personal expenses
for the reasons, that had the Tribunal applied proper multiplier, even after
deduction of 50%, loss of dependency would have been almost the same as
has been assessed by the Tribunal after deduction of 1/3 of the income

towards personal expenses.

23. Mr. Sisir Dutta, leaned Sr. Counsel, refereeing to the evidence of CW4 contended that the accident occurred due to rash & negligent driving of the
deceased and therefore, the owner insurer of the truck ought not to have

been held liable. The claimant examined 4 witnesses, out of which, CW-2 was

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 15 of 18
the eye witness, who was travelling in the vehicle with the deceased. The
CW-2 categorically stated that the truck was parked in the middle of the road
without any parking light and for negligent parking of the truck in the middle
of the road, the accident occurred. Accident Information Report, Ext.1 as well
as the charge sheet, Ext. 3 shows that the accident occurred due to fault of
the driver of the truck. CW-4 being police officer, who held preliminary
enquiry of the case, stated categorically that the truck was parked in the
middle of the road. However, he further stated that there were 12 fts. space
on the side of the divider and according to him, had the driver of the Santro
car drove the vehicle in a moderate speed, accident could have been avoided.
This part of the statement of CW-4 appears to be his opinion, whch does not
carry any evidentiary value. Apparently, CW-4 was not an eye witness and as
such he had no personal knowledge as to how the vehicle was driven or how
the accident occurred. But the categorical evidence of the eye witness, CW-2
that the truck was parked in the middle of the road without any back light,
because of which the accident occurred, supported by the documentary
evidence being the charge sheet, left no room for any speculation as to who

was at fault for the accident.

24. However, considering the facts and circumstances of the case and the
totality of the evidence, learned Tribunal in its wisdom apportioned the
liability attributing same amount of contributory negligence to the deceased, |
do not find any fault with such finding of the Tribunal in apportioning the
liability fixing 40% contributory negligence on the deceased, inasmuch as, the
claimant or the insurer of the Santro car has not challenged the finding of the

Tribunal with regard to apportionment of the liability.

25. The next point raised by learned Sr. Counsel Mr. S. Dutta is that while
assessing the income, the Tribunal did not deduct income tax. Referring to
the decision of the Apex Court in Sarfa Verma (supra), learned counsel
submits that only net income or the ‘take home pay’ after deduction of tax is

required to be taken into consideration for purpose of assessing loss of

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 16 of 18
dependency. The claimant has stated that salary of the deceased, who was a
Mechanical Engineer was Rs. 38,438/- and proved a salary certificate issued
by his employer as Ext.11. The author of the Ext.11 was also examined, but
during cross examination of the author of the Ext.11, no question was put to
the author of the certificate, whether the amount of salary mentioned in Ext.1
was the ‘take home pay’ after deducting tax etc. or not. The insurance
company has also not adduced any evidence that the salary shown in the
Ext.11 and also deposed by the claimant was not the net pay after deducting
Income tax. |n absence of such evidence, | am of the view that no deduction
towards income tax could be made. Another point raised by Mr. S. Dutta
referring to the cross examination of CW-1, that deceased used to send Rs.
7000/- to her every month by Money Order. Learned counsel Mr. S. Dutta
contended that this Rs. 7000/- was the only contribution to the family and
therefore loss of dependency ought to have been assessed on the basis of
the said contribution of Rs. 7000/- per month only. | do not find any force in
this submission of the learned counsel, for the simple reason, that only
because the deceased used to send Rs. 7000/- per month by Money Order
that itself would not necessarily mean, that the deceased was not looking

after his parents or did not contribute to the family.

26. In view of the forgoing discussions, | am of the view that the
compensation determined by the Tribunal in the instant case warrant no
interference. However, since the deceased also contributed to the accident to
the extent of 40% as decided by the Tribunal, the claimant cannot get any
compensation for the wrong done by deceased himself and therefore, the
claimant shall be entitled only to 60% of the compensation determined by the
Tribunal to be satisfied by the New India Assurance Co. Ltd.. The accident
having taken place due to contributory negligence of the deceased, who was
owner of the vehicle insured with Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd.,
Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd. cannot be saddled with the
responsibility to satisfy the 40% of the award as directed by the Tribunal, as

one cannot get compensation for his own fault in claim under Section 166 MV

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 17 of 18
Mkk

Act. That apart, deceased not being third party, so far Bajaj Allianz | nsurance
Co. is concerned, the insurer of the deceased/owner is not liable to pay

compensation for the death of the owner/insured.

2/. With the above modification in the award with regard to liability of the
appellant Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd, the appeal filed by Bajaj
Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd is allowed and the appeal filed New India
Assurance Co. Ltd. is dismissed.

Date of hearing : 03.08.2017

JUDGMENT & ORDER

These two appeals are filed by New India Assurance Co. Ltd. and
Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd., respectively, challenging the
judgment and award dated 12.07.2013 passed by MACT, Tinsukia in Mac
Case No. 29/2011.

MAC Appl. 272/2014 Page 1 of 18
2. Brief facts, which led to the present appeals are that on 31.03.2010,
Late Dipankar Kakati was travelling in a car bearing registration No. As-23/F1209 from Guwahati to Digboi. The car was driven by Late Dipankar Kakati,
who was the owner of the vehicle. The said car driven by deceased Dipankar
Kakati met with an accident after hitting against a standing truck, which was
parked on the middle of road without any parking light or indicator. As a
result of the accident, he sustained injuries and died. The parents of Late
Dipankar Kakati filed a claim petition before the MACT, Tinsukia, and the
learned Tribunal passed an award of Rs. 30,86,289/- with interest @ 6%. The
learned Tribunal apportioned the liability attributing contributory negligence
to the deceased to the extent of 40%. The vehicle owned and driven by
deceased was insured with the appellant Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co.
Ltd. and the truck involved in the accident was insured with New India
Assurance Co. Ltd.

3. Aggrieved by the judgment and award, both the Insurance Companies

have preferred the respective appeals.

4. The Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd., appellant in MAC Appl.
221/2015 raised the following points in its appeal No. 221/2015.

(i) The deceased was owner of the car and the accident having taken
place for negligence of the deceased himself, the insurer of the car
was not liable to pay any compensation, as under the policy, liability
of the Insurance Company was to indemnify the insured in respect of
claim of third party only. The deceased being owner and diver of the
vehicle, insured with Bajaj Alianz General Insurnce Co. Ltd., Tribunal
ought not to have held the insurer of the deceased, responsible for
satisfying 40% of the award.

(il) The Tribunal wrongly deducted 1/3 of the income towards personal
expenses, which as per the principle laid down in Sarala Verma
(Smt.) Vs. Delhi Transport Corp. reported in (2009) 6 SCC 121;

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 2 of 18
ought to have been 1/2 of the income, as the claim petition was filed

by mother, for death of her son.

5. The appellant in MAC Appl. 272/2014 raised the following points:

(i) While assessing loss of dependency, learned Tribunal did not
deduct the professional tax and income tax from the gross
income of the deceased.

(ii) Assessment of dependency was wrong.

(ili) © The accident occurred due to the fault of the deceased himself
and therefore, insurer of the standing truck ought not to have
been saddled with the liability to satisfy the award

(iv) | The claimant being parents, the Tribunal ought not to have

granted consortium.

6. Learned Sr. Counsel, Mr. S. Dutta for the New India Assurance Co.
Ltd., learned counsel Mr. R. Goswami for the Bajaj Allianz General Insurance
Co. Ltd. and learned counsel Mr. Surajit Dutta for the respondents were

heard at length.

7. Leaned counsel Mr. R. Goswami, contended that as per the policy, the
Insurer of the vehicle, owned by the deceased was not liable to pay any
compensation, as the deceased was not a third party. As per Section 147 of the
MV Act, liability of the Insurance Company is to indemnify the insured, for any
claim against the owner, in respect of death or injury of a third party. Learned
counsel also submitted that the Tribunal ought to have deducted 50% of the
Income while assessing the loss of dependency, considering the fact, that the
claim petition was by mother for the death of son and there was no other
dependents, but deduction of 1/3 in the instant case was improper as the
deceased left no other dependent except the parents and claim petition was filed

by his mother.

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 3 of 18
8. Mr. Surajit Dutta, learned counsel for the respondent/claimant
vehemently arguing on the locus of both the Insurance Co. to prefer appeal,
contended that the case was proceeded ex-parte against the Bajaj Allianz
General Insurance Company before the Tribunal and therefore, the said
company has no right to file appeal. Further contention of the learned
counsel was that the New India Assurance Co. having not obtained leave
under Section 170 MV Act is also not entitled to challenge the quantum of
award in appeal. In support of his submission, learned counsel placed
reliance on the decision of the Apex Court in National /[nsurance Co. Ltd.
Vs. Nicolletta Rohtagi, reported in (2002) 7 SCC 456. Mr. Surajit Dutta
also contended that although in a subsequent decision of United /ndta
/nsurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Shila Datta reported in (2011) 10 SCC 509, a
contrary view was taken by the Apex Court, the decision of Nico/letta

(Supra) being earlier in point of time is binding.

9. The Apex Court in Mico//etta Rahtog/ (supra) dealing with the right
of the insurance company to prefer appeal on merit of the claim and quantum

of compensation observed as under:

‘For the aforesaid reasons, an insurer If aggrieved against an
award, may file an appeal only on those grounds and no other.
However, by virtue of Section 170 of the 1988 Act, where in
course of an enguiry the Claims Tribunal Is satisfied that (a )
there Is a collusion between the person making a Claim and
the person against whom the Claim has been made or (b) the
person against whom the Caim has been made has failed to
contest the claim, the tribunal may, for reasons to be recorded
in writing, impolead the insurer and in that case it 1s permissible
for the insurer to contest the claim also on the grounds which
are available to the insured or to the person against whom the
Claim has been made. Thus, unless an order Is passed by the
tribunal permitting the insurer to avail the grounds available to
an insured or any other person against whom a Claim has been
made on being satisfied of the two conalitions soecitied in
Section 170 of the Act, it is not permissible to the insurer to
contest the daim on the grounds which are available to the
Insured or to a person against whom a claim has been made.
Thus where conaitions precedent embodied in Section 170 Is

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 4 of 18
satistied and award Is adverse to the interest of the insurer,
the insurer has a noht to file an appeal challenging the
guantum of compensation or negligence or contributory
negligence of the offending vehicle even if the insured has not
filed any appeal against the quantum of compensation.
Sections 149, 170 and 173 are part of one Scheme and if we
give any different interpretation to Section 173 of the 1988
Act, the same would go contrary to the scheme and object of
the Act.”

10. A three Judges Bench of the Apex Court in Shi/a Datta (supra)
answering the question whether insurer can contest a motor accident claim
on merit in regard to the quantum in addition to the ground mentioned in
Section 149(2) of the Act for avoiding liability under the policy of insurance
held as under:

‘Therefore, where the insurer is a party- respondent, either on
account of being impleaded as a party by the tribunal under
section 170 or being impleaded as a party-respondent by the
claimants in the claim petition voluntarily, it will be entitled to
contest the matter by raising all grounds, without being
restricted to the grounds available under section 149(2) of the
Act. The claim petition is maintainable against the owner and
driver without impleading the insurer as a party”

11. As per Shila Datta (supra) case, once the insurance company Is
made party respondent, irrespective of the fact, whether it is made party by
the claimant or by the Tribunal under Section 170 MV Act, it can raise all
grounds including the grounds, which are available to the insured. What
therefore follows from S/A//a Datta (supra) is that, when the insurance
company is made party even by the claimant, it can contest the claim raising
all defence available to insured and the question of obtaining leave as

contemplated in Section 170 MV Act becomes redundtant.

12. Mr. Surajit Dutta placing reliance on the decision of the Apex Court in
Sundip Kumar Batna Vs. State of Maharashtra reported in (2014) 16
SCC 623 submitted that when the co-equal Benches of equal strength of

judges of the Apex court are divergence of views, the view taken in the

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 5 of 18
former decision is binding and not the decision rendered subsequently by coequal Bench. Mr. Surajit Dutta, in support of his submission placed reliance

on paragraph - 17 of the judgment, which is reproduced below:

“17. The Constitution Bench in Union of India vs Raghubir
Singh, 1989 (2) SCC 754, has come to the condusion
extracted below:

‘27. What then should be the position in regard to the effect
of the law pronounced by a Division Bench in relation to a case
raising the same point subsequently before a Division Bench of
a smaller number of Judges? There is no constitutional or
statutory prescription in the matter, and the point is governed
entirely by the practice in India of the courts sanctified by
reoeated affirmation over a century of time. /t cannot be
doubted that in order to promote consistency and certainty in
the law laid down by a superior Court, the ideal conoaition
would be that the entire Court should sit in all cases to decide
questions of law, and for that reason the Supreme Court of the
United States does so. But having regard to the volurne of
work demanding the attention of the Court, it has been found
necessary in India as a general rule of practice and
convenience that the Court should sit in Divisions, each
Division being constituted of /udges whose number may be
determined by the exigencies of judicdal need, by the nature of
the case including any statutory mandate relative thereto, and
by such other considerations which the Chief /ustice, in whom
such authority devolves by convention, may find most
aooroonate. It is in order to guard against the possibility of
Inconsistent decisions on points of law by different Division
Benches that the Rule has been evolved, in order to promote
consistency and certainty in the develooment of the law and
its contemporary status, that the statement of the law by a
Division Bench Is considered binding on a Division Bench of the
same or lesser number of Judges. This prinaple has been
followed in Inala by several generations of / udges. ...”

13. Countering the above submission, learned Sr. Counsel Mr. Sisir Dutta
contended that the decision rendered in ShA//a Datta (supra) by a three
judge Bench is binding on the High Court and not the decision of earlier one
rendered in Micolletta Rohtag/ (supra). In support of the submission,

learned counsel placed reliance on a Division Bench judgment of this Court in

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 6 of 18
MAC Appl. No. 128/2016 (Eunus Alf Vs. Branch Manager, Ba/ja/
Allianz General [nsurance Co. Ltd). The Division bench observed as
under:

“12. The Supreme Court in the case of M.S. Sandhu Vs.
State of Punjab, (2014) 6 SCC 514 has held that in case of
contlict of co-ordinate Benches of equal strength, the latter
decision has to be followed spedally when earlier decision
rendered by co-ordinate Bench has been explained. Similar
view has been taken by a five-/udge Bench of the Madhya
Pradesh High Court in Jabalour Bus Operators Vs. State of
Madhya Pradesh, AlR 2003 (MP) 81 wherein it Is held that in
case of contlict of two Division Benches of equal strength, the
decision of earlier Division Bench shall be followed exceot
when it is explained by the latter Division Bench. In view of
aforesaid enunciation of law and taking into account the
principle of stare decisis, the decision rendered in the cases of
Reshma Kumari and Munna Lal /ain is binding on this Court.”

14. A Full bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court in /aba/pur Bus
Operators Vs. State Of M.P. & Anr. reported A/R 2003 (MP) 81,
confronted with a similar question, that in case of conflicting views between
the decisions rendered by the co-equal Benches of the Apex Court, which

view to be followed by the High Court as a binding precedent, held as under:

“Having considered the matter with broader dimensions, we
find that various High Courts have given different opinion on
the question involved) Some hold that in case of conflict
between two judgments on a point of law, later deasion
should be followed; while others say that the Court should
follow the decision which Is correct and accurate whether it is
earlier or later. There are High Courts which hold that decision
of earlier Bench Is binding because of the theory of binding
precedent and Article 141 of the Constitution of Inala. There
are also deasions which hold that Single Judge differing from
another Single Judge decision should refer the case to Larger
Bench, otherwise he Is bound by it. Deasions which are
rendered without considering the decisions expressing contrary
view have no value as a precedent. But in our considered
opinion, the position may be stated thus
With regard to the High Court, a Single Bench Is bound

by the decision of another Single Bench. In case, he
does not agree with the view of the other Single Bench,

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 7 of 18
he should refer the matter to the Larger Bench.
Similarly, Division Bench Is bound by the judgment of
earlier Division Bench. In case, it does not agree with
the view of the earlier Division Bench, it should refer
the matter to Larger Bench. !n case of conflict between
Juagments of two Division Benches of equal strength,
the decision of earlier Division Bench shall be followed
exceot when it Is explained by the latter Division Bench
In Which case the decision of later Division Bench shall
be binding. The decision of Larger Bench Is binding on
Smaller Benches.

/n case of conflict between two decisions of the Aoex Court,
Benches comprising of egual number of /udges, decision of
earlier Bench is binding unless explained by the latter Bench of
equal strength, in which case the later decision Is binding.
Decision of a Larger Bench Is binding on smaller Benches.
Therefore, the decision of earlier Division Bench, unless
distinguished by latter Division Bench, Is binding on the High
Courts and the Subordinate Courts. Similarly, in presence of
Division Bench decisions and Larger Bench deasions, the
decisions of Larger Bench are binding on the High Courts and
the Subordinate Courts. No decision of Apex Court has been
brought to our notice which holds that in case of conflict
between the two decisions by equal number of /udges, the
later decision in binding in all arcumstances, or the High
Courts and Subordinate Courts can follow any decision which Is
found correct and accurate to the case under consideration.
High Courts and Subordinate Courts should lack cormpetence to
Interoret decisions of Aoex Court since that would not only
defeat what Is envisaged under Article 141 of the Constitution
of Inala but also militate hierarchical suyoremacy of Courts. The
common thread which runs through various decisions of Aoex
Court seems to be that great value has to be attached to
precedent which has taken the shape of rule being followed by
It for the purpose of consistency and exactness in decisions of
Court, unless the Court can Clearly distinguish the decision put
ujo as a precedent or is per incunam, having been rendered
without noticing some earlier precedents with which the Court
agrees. Full Bench decision in Balbir Singh's case (supra) which
holds that if there is conflict of views between the two coequal Benches of the Apex Court, the High Court has to follow
the judgment which appears to it to state the law more
elaborately and more accurately and in conformity with the
scheme of the Act, in our considered opinion, for reasons
recorded in the preceding paragraoh of this judgment, does

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 8 of 18
not lay down the correct law as to application of precedent
and Is, therefore, over-ruled on this point.”

15. Although, with regard to right to file appeal by Insurance Company,
the Apex court in Nico//etta Rohtagi (Supra) expressed somewhat different
view, in the subsequent decision by three Judges Bench in ShAi//la Datta
(Supra), the Apex Court considered and explained the decision of M/co/letta
Rohtagi (supra) in detail and referred certain issues to larger Bench.
However, so far the question with regard to right of Insurance Company to
file appeal taking the ground in addition to Section 149 (2) MV Act, the Apex
Court clearly held that once the insurance company is made a party
respondent, irrespective of obtaining any leave under Section 170 MV Act,
can contest the claim and prefer appeal taking all grounds available to the
insured, besides the statutory defence under Section 149(2) MV Act.

16. In view of the above situation, when the Apex Court in SA//a Datta
(Supra) explained the earlier decision in NMicco/letta Rohtag/ (supra) and
decided the question as indicated above in favour of the insurer, | am of the
view, that in view of the decision of the Division Bench of this Court and also
the principle laid down by the Full Bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court, the
decision rendered by three judges Bench of Apex Court in Shi/la Datta
(Supra) subsequently, is binding on this Court. Be that as it may, while going
through the record of the Tribunal, | find that the Bajaj Allianz General
Insurance Company prayed for leave under Section 170 of the MV Act and
the Tribunal allowed the Insurance Company by order dated 01.06.2012 to
raise all defence, which could be raised by insured in addition to defence
available under Section 149(2). Therefore, the question raised by Mr. Surajit
Dutta challenging the right of the insurance company to prefer appeal, is
redundant, so far the Bajaj Alliance General Insurance Co. Ltd. is concerned.
So far the New India Assurance Co. is concerned, as per Shi/a Datta (supra)
case, the New India Assurance Co. having been impleaded as a party

respondent, obviously has the right to appeal. In that view of the matter, | do

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 9 of 18
not find any force in the submission of the learned counsel Mr. Surajit Dutta

that the appeal filed by the Insurance Companies are not maintainable.

17. Next point raised by Surajit Dutta was that the Bajaj Allianz General
Insurance Company is debarred from raising any defence on the basis of the
policy, in absence of evidence adduced by the Insurance Company inasmuch
as, the policy was not proved by the insurance company. To buttress the
submission, Mr. Dutta placed reliance on a decision of Patna High Court in
Sial Sinha Vs. Shivadhari Sinha & Ors. reported in A/R 1972 Patna 8&1.
There is no denial, that Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company did not file
written statement and for that matter, no evidence was also adduced,

however, it appeared subsequently and contested the case.

18. It transpires from the record, that the policy under which the vehicle
of the deceased was insured has been proved as Ext.10 by the claimant
himself. Since the policy has been proved and brought on evidence, it is
Immaterial who has adduced such evidence and proved the policy. Since
there is evidence on record, both the parties can rely upon such evidence, as
law never preclude any party from relying on the evidence adduced by the
Opposite party. Therefore, there is no bar on the part of the Insurance
Company in replying upon such documentary evidence, though adduced by
the claimant. The insurance policy (Ext.10) transpires that it was a package

policy for private vehicle.

19. Section 147 of the MV Act reads as under:

‘147 Requirements of policies and limits of liability. —
(1) In order to comply with the requirements of this Chapter, a
policy of insurance must be a policy which—
(a) is issued by a person who is an authorised insurer;
and
(fb) insures the person or classes of persons specified in
the policy to the extent specified in sub-section (2)—
(i) against any liability which may be incurred
by him in respect of the death of or bodily 2’
[injury to any person, including owner of the
goods or his authorised representative carried in

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 10 of 18
the vehicle] or damage to any property of a
third party caused by or arising out of the use
of the vehicle in a public place;
(ii) against the death of or bodily injury to any
passenger of a public service vehicle caused by
or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a
public place:
Provided that a policy shall not be required—
(i) to cover liability in respect of the death, arising out
of and in the course of his employment, of the
employee of a person insured by the policy or in
respect of bodily injury sustained by such an employee
arising out of and in the course of his employment
other than a liability arising under the Workmen's
Compensation Act, 1923 (8 of 1923) in respect of the
death of, or bodily injury to, any such employee—
(a) engaged in driving the vehicle, or
(b) if it is a public service vehicle engaged as
conductor of the vehicle or in examining tickets
on the vehicle, or
(c) if it is a goods carriage, being carried in the
vehicle, or
(ii) to cover any contractual liability.
Explanation. —For the removal of doubts, it is hereby
declared that the death of or bodily injury to any
person or damage to any property of a third party shall
be deemed to have been caused by or to have arisen
out of, the use of a vehicle in a public place
notwithstanding that the person who is dead or injured
or the property which is damaged was not in a public
place at the time of the accident, if the act or omission
which led to the accident occurred in a public place.
(2) Subject to the proviso to sub-section (1), a policy of
Insurance referred to in sub-section (1), shall cover any liability
Incurred in respect of any accident, up to the following limits,
namely: —
(a) Save as provided in clause (b), the amount of
liability incurred;
(b) In respect of damage to any property of a third
party, a limit of rupees six thousand:

Provided that any policy of insurance issued with any
limited liability and in force, immediately before the
commencement of this Act, shall continue to be effective for a
period of four months after such commencement or till the
date of expiry of such policy whichever ts earlier.

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 11 of 18
(3) A policy shall be of no effect for the purposes of this
Chapter unless and until there is issued by the insurer in
favour of the person by whom the policy is effected a
certificate of insurance in the prescribed form and containing
the prescribed particulars of any condition subject to which the
policy is issued and of any other prescribed matters; and
different forms, particulars and matters may be prescribed in
different cases.

(4) Where a cover note issued by the insurer under the
provisions of this Chapter or the rules made thereunder is not
followed by a policy of insurance within the prescribed time,
the insurer shall, within seven days of the expiry of the period
of the validity of the cover note, notify the fact to the
registering authority in whose records the vehicle to which the
cover note relates has been registered or to such other
authority as the State Government may prescribe.

(5) Notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time
being in force, an insurer issuing a policy of insurance under
this section shall be liable to indemnify the person or classes of
persons specified in the policy in respect of any liability which
the policy purports to cover in the case of that person or those
classes of persons.”

20. It would appear from the provision of Section 147 MV Act, that under
the policy, liability of Insurance Company is to indemnify the insured owner in
respect of death or injury of any third party, which also necessarily included
certain categories of employees mentioned in Clause (a), (b) and (c) of the
proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 147 MV act. It is also settled position of
law, that there are two types of insurance policy, one Is statutory policy and
the other is contractual policy. Under statutory policy, liability of the
Insurance Company Is limited to what is laid down in Section 147 of the MV
Act. Under Section 147 of the MV Act, Insurance Company has no liability to
pay any compensation in respect of death or injury of the owner/insured
himself, unless there is some contract between the insurer and the insured to
that effect. It is abundantly clear from the provision of Section 147 MV Act
and also Section 163-A or 140 MV Act that the liability to pay compensation

to the victim of motor vehicle accident is basically on the owner of the

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 12 of 18
vehicle, which the insurer is required to indemnify by virtue of the contract of
the policy. The Apex Court in New /ndia Assurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Prabha
Devi & Ors. reported in (2013) 14 SCC 719, the Apex Court dealing with
the liability of the insurer in respect of death or injury of the insured held as

under:

‘8. We have perused the judgment of this Court in the case of
Dhanraj Supra. !n that case, the appellant who was the insurer
was travelling in the insured vehicle which met with an
acadent, In the acadent, the appellant as well as the other
passengers received injuries. A number of Claim petitions carne
to be filed. The appellant who was the insurer also filed a
Caim petition. The MACT held the ariver of the /eeo
responsible for the acadent. /n all the Claim petitions filed by
the other passengers, MACT airected that the appellant (the
owner) as well as the driver and the [Insurance Cormoany were
lable to pay cornpensation. Furthermore, in the Cdaim petition
filed by the appellant, the MACT directed the driver and the
/nsurance Company to pay compensation to the appellant. The
aforesaid finding of the MACT was upheld by the High Court in
the appeal filed by the Insurance Company. The Insurance
Company was, in appeal before this Court challenging the
Judgment of the High Court awarding cornoensation to the
owner of the insured vehicle. Taking into consideration the
provision contained in Section 147 of the Act, this Court
observed as follows :
“8. Thus, an insurance policy covers the lability
Incurred by the insured in respect of death of or bodily
Iryury to any person (including an owner of the goods
or his authorised reoresentative) carried in the vehicle
or damage to any property of a third party caused by
or arising out of the use of the vehicle. Section 147
does not require an insurance company to assume risk
for death or bodily injury to the owner of the vehicle.

9. In the case of Onental Insurance Co. Ltd. versus
Sunita Rathi it has been held that the lability of an
Insurance company Is only for the purpose of
Indermifying the insured against labilities incurred
towards a third person or in respect of darnages to
property. Thus, where the insured |.e. an owner of the
vehicle has no lability to a third party the insurance
company has no lability also.

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 13 of 18
10. In this case, it has not been shown that the policy
covered any risk for injury to the owner himself. We
are unable to acceot the contention that the premium
of Rs.4989 paid under the heading “Own damage’, the
words “oremium on vehicle and non-electrical
accessories” aooear. It Is thus Clear that this premium
Is towards damage to the vehicle and not for injury to
the person of the owner. An owner of a vehicle can
only claim provided a personal acadent insurance has
been taken out. /n this case there Is no such
insurance.”

9. In view of the aforesaid ratio of law, the claim made by the
resoondents could not have been allowed. Consequently, Civil
Appeal No. 479 of 2007 Is allowed. The imougned Award as
well as the imougned judgment of the High Court are set
aside.”

21. The perusal of the policy (Ext.10) shows, that the deceased as owner
of his vehicle, paid an extra premium for personal accident coverage and
therefore, the liability of the insurer in the instant case for death or injury of
the owner, could not be beyond what Is provided in the policy as per contract
between the insurer and insured. Since the deceased himself was the owner
of the vehicle insured with Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd, the Bajaj
Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd is not liable to pay any compensation as
directed by the Tribunal for the simple reason, that as per policy and also as
per the provision of Section 147 of the MV Act, Bajaj Allianz General
Insurance Co. Ltd has no liability for the death or injury of the owner, except,

what is provided in the policy under personal accident coverage.

22. Leaned counsel for both the Insurance Company submitted that while
calculating the loss of dependency, Tribunal deducted 1/3 of the income as
future prospect, whereas, as per the principle laid down in Sarla Verma
(Supra) such deduction for personal expenses ought to have been 1/2 of the
income. The Apex Court in Sar/a Verma (supra) held, that when deceased is
bachelor and claimants are parents, normally 50% of the income is to be
deducted as personal and living expenses. However, where the family of the

bachelor is large and dependent on the income of the deceased, the

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 14 of 18
deduction on personal expenses may be restricted to 1/3 and contribution of
the family shall be treated as 2/3. In the instant case, evidently there is no
other dependent except the mother of the deceased and therefore, as per the
principle laid down in Sar/a Verma (supra), deduction ought to have been
made 50% towards personal expenses of the deceased. What is to be noted
In the instant case is that Tribunal applied multiplier 11, with reference to the
age of the claimant, whereas, it is now settled principle of law, that multiplier
Shall be with reference of the age of the deceased and not with reference to
the age of the parents. Learned Tribunal seems to have fallen in error by
applying multiplier 11, which ought to have been 16 with reference to the
age of the deceased. Had the Tribunal took the proper multiplier 16, in that
case, even after deduction of 50% towards personal expenses, loss of
dependency would have remained almost same. The Apex Court in Ran/ana
Prakash And Ors vs The Divisional Manager And Anr reported in
(2011) 14 SCC 639 observed that irrespective of who files the appeal, the
appropriate course for the High Court is to examine the facts and by applying
the relevant principles, determine the just compensation i.e. award is just and
reasonable. The only embargo put on such obligation of the High Court in
determining just compensation is that in an appeal by insurance company for
reduction of compensation, enhancement of compensation is not permissible
without appeal by the claimant. Taking note of the fact that the Tribunal
wrongly took a lower multiplier, | am not inclined to interfere with the
decision of the Tribunal with regard to deduction towards personal expenses
for the reasons, that had the Tribunal applied proper multiplier, even after
deduction of 50%, loss of dependency would have been almost the same as
has been assessed by the Tribunal after deduction of 1/3 of the income

towards personal expenses.

23. Mr. Sisir Dutta, leaned Sr. Counsel, refereeing to the evidence of CW4 contended that the accident occurred due to rash & negligent driving of the
deceased and therefore, the owner insurer of the truck ought not to have

been held liable. The claimant examined 4 witnesses, out of which, CW-2 was

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 15 of 18
the eye witness, who was travelling in the vehicle with the deceased. The
CW-2 categorically stated that the truck was parked in the middle of the road
without any parking light and for negligent parking of the truck in the middle
of the road, the accident occurred. Accident Information Report, Ext.1 as well
as the charge sheet, Ext. 3 shows that the accident occurred due to fault of
the driver of the truck. CW-4 being police officer, who held preliminary
enquiry of the case, stated categorically that the truck was parked in the
middle of the road. However, he further stated that there were 12 fts. space
on the side of the divider and according to him, had the driver of the Santro
car drove the vehicle in a moderate speed, accident could have been avoided.
This part of the statement of CW-4 appears to be his opinion, whch does not
carry any evidentiary value. Apparently, CW-4 was not an eye witness and as
such he had no personal knowledge as to how the vehicle was driven or how
the accident occurred. But the categorical evidence of the eye witness, CW-2
that the truck was parked in the middle of the road without any back light,
because of which the accident occurred, supported by the documentary
evidence being the charge sheet, left no room for any speculation as to who

was at fault for the accident.

24. However, considering the facts and circumstances of the case and the
totality of the evidence, learned Tribunal in its wisdom apportioned the
liability attributing same amount of contributory negligence to the deceased, |
do not find any fault with such finding of the Tribunal in apportioning the
liability fixing 40% contributory negligence on the deceased, inasmuch as, the
claimant or the insurer of the Santro car has not challenged the finding of the

Tribunal with regard to apportionment of the liability.

25. The next point raised by learned Sr. Counsel Mr. S. Dutta is that while
assessing the income, the Tribunal did not deduct income tax. Referring to
the decision of the Apex Court in Sarfa Verma (supra), learned counsel
submits that only net income or the ‘take home pay’ after deduction of tax is

required to be taken into consideration for purpose of assessing loss of

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 16 of 18
dependency. The claimant has stated that salary of the deceased, who was a
Mechanical Engineer was Rs. 38,438/- and proved a salary certificate issued
by his employer as Ext.11. The author of the Ext.11 was also examined, but
during cross examination of the author of the Ext.11, no question was put to
the author of the certificate, whether the amount of salary mentioned in Ext.1
was the ‘take home pay’ after deducting tax etc. or not. The insurance
company has also not adduced any evidence that the salary shown in the
Ext.11 and also deposed by the claimant was not the net pay after deducting
Income tax. |n absence of such evidence, | am of the view that no deduction
towards income tax could be made. Another point raised by Mr. S. Dutta
referring to the cross examination of CW-1, that deceased used to send Rs.
7000/- to her every month by Money Order. Learned counsel Mr. S. Dutta
contended that this Rs. 7000/- was the only contribution to the family and
therefore loss of dependency ought to have been assessed on the basis of
the said contribution of Rs. 7000/- per month only. | do not find any force in
this submission of the learned counsel, for the simple reason, that only
because the deceased used to send Rs. 7000/- per month by Money Order
that itself would not necessarily mean, that the deceased was not looking

after his parents or did not contribute to the family.

26. In view of the forgoing discussions, | am of the view that the
compensation determined by the Tribunal in the instant case warrant no
interference. However, since the deceased also contributed to the accident to
the extent of 40% as decided by the Tribunal, the claimant cannot get any
compensation for the wrong done by deceased himself and therefore, the
claimant shall be entitled only to 60% of the compensation determined by the
Tribunal to be satisfied by the New India Assurance Co. Ltd.. The accident
having taken place due to contributory negligence of the deceased, who was
owner of the vehicle insured with Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd.,
Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd. cannot be saddled with the
responsibility to satisfy the 40% of the award as directed by the Tribunal, as

one cannot get compensation for his own fault in claim under Section 166 MV

MAC App. 272/2014 Page 17 of 18
Mkk

Act. That apart, deceased not being third party, so far Bajaj Allianz | nsurance
Co. is concerned, the insurer of the deceased/owner is not liable to pay

compensation for the death of the owner/insured.

2/. With the above modification in the award with regard to liability of the
appellant Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd, the appeal filed by Bajaj
Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd is allowed and the appeal filed New India
Assurance Co. Ltd. is dismissed.

| UDGMENT AND ORDER (Oral)

Heard Mr. S.K. Goswami, learned counsel for the appellant. None appears

on call for the respondent No. 1. However, notices were duly served.

2. By filing this appeal under Section 30 of the Workmen’s Compensation
Act, 1923 (now called as Employees’ Compensation Act, 1923 and hereinafter
referred to as “the Act”), the appellant has challenged the judgment and order dated
16.05.2007 passed by the learned Commissioner, Workmen's Compensation, Nagaon
In N.W.C. Case No. 113/2004.

3. The present appeal was admitted by order dated 26.10.2009 on the

following substantial questions of law:
MFA 60/2009
(1) Whether the learned Commissioner, Workmen's Cormpensation
could have, as has been done in the present case, assess the
monthly wages of a workman contrary to the definition given in
Section 2(n) of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923, taking
together salary and daily allowances?

ay Whether the learned Commissioner, Workmen's Cornoensation
could have, as has been done in the present case, assess the
compensation considering the loss of earning capacity assessed by
the doctor, which is contrary to the loss of earning capacity
provided in Schedule | of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923?

(il) ~~ Any other question, which may be allowed to be raised at the time

of hearing?

4. At the outset, the learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that
issue No. 1 has already been settled by various judgments of this Court by which
daily allowance has been held to be a part of the salary and therefore, he does not
press the substantial question of law No. 1 as formulated by this Court while

admitting the appeal.

5. The learned counsel for the appellant has referred to the evidence of
Doctor (PW.2), who has admitted in his cross-examination that Exbt.10 i.e. medical
certificate of disability was issued on the basis of the x-ray report which was done at
the initial stage when the accident had occurred. He has further referred to the
cross-examination wherein PW.2 |.e. Doctor had admitted that the respondent No. 1
could carry out any other work. Accordingly, it is submitted that when the Doctor
(PW.2) himself has admitted in his cross-examination that the respondent No. 1
could carry out any other work and further in his cross-examination where he had
admitted that the fracture in the rib would take six months time to heal and fracture
in the ankle joint would also take six month to heal there was no material on record
to treat the injury as one which could produce permanent disability. It is sulomitted

that by no stretch of imagination, in light of the admission in the cross-examination

MFA 60/2009 Page 2 of 6
of Doctor (PW.2) can the injury be classified to be one which is covered by the
provisions of Section 4(1)(c)(ii) of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923. It is
Submitted that if the injury took six months time to heal and the respondent No. 1
could carry out any other work, the learned Commissioner, Workmen's Compensation
had erred in law and on facts by not treating the said injury as the one which is
covered by the provisions of Section 4(1)(d) of the Workmen’s Compensation Act,
1923. Referring to the injury report (Exbt.10), the learned counsel for the appellant
submits that there was no evidence of any medical investigation which was carried
out prior to 05.03.2006 to show that after the date of the accident the patient was
developing Chronic Osteochondritis of left side of chest with arthralgia of right ankle
and, as such, the assessment of 20% permanent physical disability and the Doctor’s
opinion that the earning ability of respondent No. 1 was reduced by 40% _ is without
any basis and was only a guess work. As per the statement made by the PW.2 i.e.
Doctor in his cross-examination, he had stated that he had taken note of the
Schedule of the Workmen’s Compensation Act while certifying the loss of earning
ability at 40% and in this context, the learned counsel for the appellant submits that
for major condition of amputation of part of the leg, 40% of reducing of earning
ability is prescribed in Schedule-I, Part-I! of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923,
and therefore, merely because there was a injury in the wrist and ankle, the
reduction of earning ability could not have been accepted by the learned
Commissioner, Workmen’s Compensation at 40% in terms of the Doctor’s certificate
(Exbt.10).

6. Considering the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the
appellant, it would be relevant to refer to the meaning of Osteochondritis which as
per the new Medical Dictionary, 3 Edition published by Oxford and |BH Publishing

Co. Ltd. is as follows:

“Osteochonaritis- inflammation of bone and cartilage o
dissecans a alisorder following an injury, releasing small fragments of

cartilage or bone into the joint soace especially of the knee and elbow

MFA 60/2009 Page 3 of 6
o fjuvenilis inflammation of a growing area of bone in a child or

adolescent. /t causes local pain and distortion of a joint.”

7. Having notice of definition of the disease Chronic Osteochondritis, there
Is nothing on record that by what process the Doctor (PW.2) arrived at a finding that
there was inflammation of bone and cartilage without getting an x-ray done prior to
issuance of the certificate. He has not recorded the clinical finding by virtue of which,
he arrived at a finding of the existence of chronic Osteochondritis on the respondent
No. 1.

8. Moreover, on the perusal of the materials available on record, it appears
that the medical certificate (Exbt.10) was issued on 05.03.2006 whereas the present
complaint case was filed by the respondent No. 1 before the court of learned
Commissioner Workmen’s Compensation, Nagaon on 14.09.2004. Therefore, as on
the date of the filing of the said complaint case, the document of Exbt.10 was not in

existence.

9, At this juncture, the learned counsel for the appellant has referred to the
case of National [Insurance Co. Ltd! Vs. Bimal Nath, 2009 (1) GLT 370 and place
paragraph 22 thereof and has submitted that in view of the admission made by the
Doctor (PW.2) that the fracture would take six months time for the injury complaint
to heal and that he was able to take other works as per the cross-examination of
PW.2 |.e. Doctor, this Court may treat/consider the injury complained of to be one
under Section 4(1)(d) of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923 and to that effect

the impugned order may be modified.

10. Having considered the order of this Court passed in the case of Bimal/
Nath (supra) and on consideration of the statement made by the Doctor (PW.2) in
his cross-examination as referred earlier, this Court has no hesitation to hold that the
respondent No. 1 did not suffer a permanent partial disability within the meaning of
Section 4(1)(c)(il) of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923, but the injury

MFA 60/2009 Page 4 of 6
complaint of is squarely covered within the meaning of Section 4(1)(d) of the
Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923 by holding that the injury complained of is
temporary partial disablement for a maximum period of six months as suggested by
the Doctor (PW.2).

11. Accepting the finding of the learned Commissioner, Workmen's
Compensation, Nagaon that the respondent No. 1 was earning a sum of Rs.4,000/per month, in terms of the provisions of Section 4(1)(d) of the Workmen's
Compensation Act, 1923, he is entitled to half monthly payment of 25% of the
monthly wages of the employees i.e. Rs. 1,000/- and therefore, the computation of
compensation would be Rs.1000/- X 2 X 6 = Rs.24,000/-.

12. However, it is noticed by this Court that out of the sum of Rs. 1,97, 712/deposited by the appellant, 50% of such deposit has been withdrawn by the
respondent No. 1 on the strength of the order dated 28.11.2007. Therefore,
considering the fact that the respondent No. 1 at the relevant time was a driver, he
may had spent the said sum and therefore, the appellant may not be able to recover
the aforesaid sum. Therefore, in view of the evidence by the PW.1 that he has spent
amount of Rs.30,000/- for medical expenses, the amount of compensation is
assessed Rs.24,000/- while the balance amount of money withdrawn is required to
be considered as the cost of treatment and the same is also awarded to the
appellant as full and final compensation for the injury which he suffered in the

accident complained of.

13. This appeal stands allowed and the impugned judgment and order dated
16.05.2007 passed by the learned Commissioner, Workmen's Compensation, Nagaon
In N.W.C. Case No. 113/2004 stand partially modified to the extent as indicated

above.

MFA 60/2009 Page 5 of 6
14. Needless to say that the appellant shall become entitled to the refund of

2) Whether the soecal allowances paid to be a
workman by the nature of his employment can be

the purpose of assessment of cormpensation under

Workmen's Cormoensation Act, 1923?”

3. The case of the respondent/claimant is that he was employed
as a driver of the respondent No.2 herein in respect of a Bus bearing
Registration No. AXA -6963. On 17.12.2000 when the said vehicle

herein and driving licence was also valid till that period.

5. The respondent herein approached the court of learned
Commissioner, Workmen Compensation, Zone-3, Tezpur claiming

MFA No. 107/2004 Page 2 of 6
respondent No.1/claimant examined himself and as per record both
the appellant as well as respondent No.2 had filed their written
statement therein in the case. The appellant herein failed to appear

at the time of argument.

6. In course of trial, the learned Commissioner, Workmen’s

3) Whether the claim petition is maintainable in the present form?

4) Whether the O.P. are liable to pay compensation as claimed by the

5) If yes, what relief is the claimant petitioner entitled to?

7. The issues No.1 to 4 were decided in favour of the respondent
No.1/claimant. In respect of the issue No.5, the learned
Commissioner, Workmen's Compensation accepted the certificate
given by the Doctor and accepted the assessment of disablement at
30% by accepting the income of the respondent No.1 as Rs.4,000/per month and also accepted the age of the claimant as 36 years of
age at the time of accident, and as per Section 2(a)(ill) of the
Workmen’s Compensation Act, the compensation was calculated as:

@ 9% per annum. Without indicating the period from which the
Interest started, the learned Commissioner calculated interest @ 9%
amounting to Rs.33,567.97 and the aggregate amount compensation

earning capacity is required to be assessed by a qualified medical
practitioner. It is further stated that as per the requirement of law, it
is only a Doctor, who issued the certificate can give evidence as
regards the certificate issued by him. It is also stated that the
qualified medical practitioner is required to assess the percentage of
disablement as well as the loss of earning capacity by the injured,

having regard to any work which he was capable of doing.

9. In view of the above, it is submitted that without examining
the qualified medical practitioner, who had given a certificate of
disablement, the assessment of disablement and loss of earning
capacity by the learned Commissioner is not sustainable in the eye of

law.

10. —‘It is further submitted that the learned Commissioner was also
required to be satisfied that the loss of earning capacity is not only in
respect of the work as workman as carrying at the time of the
accident but also it ought to have considered loss of earning capacity
in any other employment which he could have performed at the

relevant time.

11. =In support of his contention, the learned counsel for the
appellant has relied on the case of National /nsurance Company
Limited Vs. Bimal Nath reported in 2009 (1) GLT 370; (2009) 2 GLR

There was an old sluice gate opening of size 1.83, X
1.83m (16ft x 6ft) over Bamonbodi Khal under Udharbond LAC

In Cachar District which was stated to be constructed long
back. The total value of Civil
Works (Concrete Structure, Earthwork, etc.) So
far, the security money deducted amounting to Rs.1757658.00
is with the Department. On observation of the nearby old sluice gate it is
found that the shaft along with operating structure of the sluice
IS in existence. However, as the entire steel
Shutter is under water, as such it could not be ascertained
whether any gap is existing in between the shutter and the
bottom slab of the sluice. It appears that the civil structure Is
withholding earth fill of height to the extent of 7m or so. The
materials and concrete blocks were tested by National | nstitute
of Technology, Silchar which are found to be in order. But there should have been a permanent sign board for public
awareness. He has therefore proposed action against the erring

officials for defects in execution and supervision of mechanical

work. Page 4o0f 5
We, therefore, finally dispose of the petition with the following
directions:

I) The Principal Secretary shall ensure that the defects in
the newly constructed sluice gate are soon rectified;
and

li) An appropriate action shall be taken against the erring

Mr.C Choudhury, learned Advocate General, Assam,

In the present public interest litigation, the petitioner has
alleged huge misappropriation of government money in the
construction of sluice gate across river Babon Bandi at Gossaipur
Part-I village, Udharbond in Cachar District. According to him,
due to poor quality of material and workmanship, a portion of
the sluice gate broke down without any just cause as inferior M
10 concrete was used.

Having regard to the serious allegation made in the
petition, we directed Shri Hemanta Narzary, Principal Secretary
to the Government of Assam, Water Resources Department to
personally visit the site and submit his report. The report of the

Principal Secretary reads as under:

1.83m (16ft x 6ft) over Bamonbodi Khal under Udharbond LAC
Pagelof5
In Cachar District which was stated to be constructed long
back. As the old sluice gate used to take long time to drain out
the accumulated water in the country side, as such the
department took up implementation of an additional sluice gate
having two numbers of opening of size 2.4m x 1.8m each.

The Administrative Approval of the scheme
“Construction of Sluice for additional opening over Bamonbodi

water is flowing from country side to river side which could also
be visualised and some vortices were observed in the river side
of the sluice. On observation of the nearby old sluice gate it is
found that the shaft along with operating structure of the sluice
IS in existence. The Executive Engineer, Mechanical informed
that due to damages in the existing steel shutter of the old
Sluice, the gate Is in non-operable condition and hence the gate
Is closed. During interaction with the local people they
expressed their satisfaction with the civil structural works. The
local resident also said that light to heavy vehicle passes
through the embankment over the sluice gate structure. The
local people expressed their utter disappointment with the
mechanical work of the sluice and were not satisfied with the
steel gate structure of the sluice. They informed that whenever
the gate is closed there is a gap in between the steel shutter
and bottom slab of the sluice. However, as the entire steel
Shutter is under water, as such it could not be ascertained
whether any gap is existing in between the shutter and the
bottom slab of the sluice. The fabrications of the steel shutter,
fabrication of steel guide, major part of the lifting arrangement
were under water and as such it is not possible to ascertain the
defects if any. However the exposed steel work above water
l.e. the steel gangway and steel platform of the sluice gate
were found not having proper finishing. Welding of some
connecting steel members with the platform was observed to
be detached.

CONCLUSION & FINDINGS:

L. It is a fact that there is an existing sluice gate which
was constructed long back and was inadequate to cater the
need of the area. Therefore the additional sluice gate (new
gate) is constructed. As per the sanctioned estimate, the time
of completion of work is 3(three) years, but as per work order
for civil works, the time of completion of work is 90 (ninety)
days. It is observed that civil construction work took almost two
and half years to complete, which appears to be inconformity to
the time span indicated in the estimate.

2. At present the entire sluice gate shutter structures is
under water and as such existence of gap what so ever can be
ascertained only after receding of water level in the dry season.
The old sluice gate is of opening size 1.83m x 1.83mi.e. (6ft x
6ft) (Single shutter) and a new sluice gate is of opening size
2.40m x 1.80m (double shutter). As such both the sluice
requires different types of gate structure. Shaft of the old sluice
Is found to be existing as well as other appurtenant structures.

Page 30f5
3. The exposed portion (above water) of the newly
constructed steel structure appears to be not up to the mark as
observed above. The defects are to be rectified. This can be
done during dry season while rectifying the defects in steel
shutter structure if any. Action against officer responsible for
defect in execution and supervision of mechanical work will be
Initiated.

4. The major portion of civil structure of the newly
constructed sluice gate is presently under water except the top
part of the earthen dam over the sluice (the embankment
structure) and the guide channel supporting columns. At
present the dam over the sluice that is embankment structure
IS extensively used as road. It appears that the civil structure Is
withholding earth fill of height to the extent of 7m or so. The
materials and concrete blocks were tested by National | nstitute
of Technology, Silchar which are found to be in order. As such
the quality of civil construction appears to in order.

5. Non sign board indicating implementation of work was
found at the site. The Executive Engineer showed photographs
showing erection of sign board at the time of starting of work.
But there should have been a permanent sign board for public
awareness.

6. The security money in hand with the department can be
forfeited and utilized in rectifying the defects of the Mechanical
steel structure after ascertaining all the defects thoroughly
during winter season.

7. The list of officers accompanying the undersigned
during inspection is enclosed at Annexure-l and few
photographs taken during inspector of the site is enclosed at
Annexure-I1.

Sd/- Illegible

Principal Secretary to the Govt. of Assam,
Water Resources etc Department,

Dispur, Guwahati-6”

According to the Principal Secretary, the newly

constructed steel structure of the sluice gate was not up to the

mark. He has therefore proposed action against the erring

officials for defects in execution and supervision of mechanical

work. We are satisfied with the report of the Principal Secretary.

Page 4o0f 5
We, therefore, finally dispose of the petition with the following
directions:

I) The Principal Secretary shall ensure that the defects in
the newly constructed sluice gate are soon rectified;
and

li) An appropriate action shall be taken against the erring
Officials for allowing construction of sub-standard
Sluice gate.

HON’BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. AJIT SINGH
HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MANOJIT BHUYAN

(Ajit Singh, C.J.)
Mr.S Borthakur and Mr.V Rajkhowa, learned counsel for the
petitioners.

Mr.N Dutta, learned Senior counsel assisted by Mr. R Dhar,
learned Additional Senior Government Advocate and Mr.AK
Phukan, learned counsel for Respondent Nos.1 to 5, Mrs. M
Hazarika, learned counsel for Respondent No.7 and Mr.
S.C.Keyal, learned Assistant Solicitor General of India for
Respondent No.8.
This public interest litigation has been filed by 3(three)
petitioners praying for conducting investigation to Dispur Police
Station Case No. 1498/2015 either by the Central Bureau of

Investigation or by a Special Investigation Team.

2. The Guwahati Metropolitan Development Authority selected
one Louis Berger International, a Multinational Company based in
the United States of America, to manage water supply facilities in
the city of Guwahati. At present 3(three) water supply projects are
going on in the Guwahati Metropolitan Development Authority,
one of which is Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal
Mission (JNNURM) funded project for the South-west region, the
other is Japan International Cooperation Agency (JAICA) funded
project for north and south central division and the third one is an
Asian Development Bank (ADB) funded project for south- east
region of Guwahati. All these 3(three) projects are for providing
round-the-clock supply of water and the Louis Berger International
is one of the consultant companies in those projects, which owns
the consultancy project of the ‘Restoration and Conservation of

Bharalu and Kalong’.
Page 1 of 6
3. The said company designed and managed the construction
of new water work facilities. It also evaluated and updated the
existing facilities, including intake sites, water treatment plants,
raw water transmission mains and pumps, clear water
transmission mains and pumps, reservoirs, water distribution

networks and water testing laboratories.

4. However, there were some media reports that the said
company adopted illegal means for obtaining those projects in the
State of Goa and Guwahati resorting to bribery to various
government agencies and as such, it was prosecuted by the
United States Justice Department, for violation of anti-bribery
provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1997. The
petitioners could collect some information regarding the said
development from the website of Justice Department of the
United States of America which has been appended to this petition

as Annexure-C and reads as follows:
“The company has operated in India since 1998 and had
offices in Gurgaon, Mumbai, Chennai and Hyderabad. Along
with several consortium partners, the company won two
water development projects in Goa and Guwahati. The
company paid bribes to win both of those contracts. The
bribe money was disguised aS payments to vendors for
services that had never actually been rendered. The
Company through its employees and agents and its
consortium partners kept track of the bribe payments by
circulating a spread-sheet amongst themselves showing the
proportionate share of each bribe that he had paid to the
foreign officials overseeing their work on the Goa and
Guwahati projects.”

5. It is stated by the petitioners that the penalty of
17,100,000 dollars was imposed on the company as it chose not
to contest the admissibility of the statements of facts during
prosecution and an agreement was executed deferring the

prosecution till the payment of penalty is made.

Page 2 of 6
6. The petitioners lodged a first information report in the
Dispur Police Station which is registered as Dispur Police Station
case No. 1498/2015 under section 7/13 (i)(d) of the Prevention of
Corruption Act, 1988 relating to the said incident on the basis of
the information received by them from the aforesaid website. The
petitioners’ grievance is that the case has not been effectively
investigated as it should have been and as such they have prayed
for an independent investigation by the Central Bureau of

Investigation or by a special team.

It may be noted that Home and Political Department,
Government of Assam, also lodged a complaint to the CID, Assam,
on 17/8/2015 which was registered as CID Police Station Case No.
41/2015 for offences under Sections 120B/406/420 of Indian
Penal Code read with Section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of
Corruption Act, 1988. When the petitioners lodged the case in
Dispur Police Station, the same was amalgamated with the CID
Police Station Case No. 41/2015.

7. The senior Superintendent of Police, CID, Assam and the
Secretary to the Government of Assam, Home and Political
Department, have filed their respective affidavits informing this
Court about present status of the case from which it transpires
that the investigation team recorded the statements of some
witnesses and also requested the Court of Chief Judicial
Magistrate, Kamrup, to issue of Letter Rogatory, enabling them to
conduct further investigation in the United States of America and
to collect evidence from foreign witnesses, documents etc. The
same has already been issued by the Court on 04/05/2016 which
has been forwarded to the competent authority of the United

States of America on 10/5/2016 through proper channel.

8. On perusal of the records, we found that the investigation

needs to be accelerated. We also noted that although the

Page 3 of 6
petitioners have prayed for investigation by the Central Bureau of
Investigation, the same was not made a party. Therefore, as per
our direction, the Central Bureau of Investigation has been

impleaded as respondent.

9. During the course of hearing, investigation progress
sheet was produced in the court. We have meticulously gone
through the same and found that after lodging of the first
information report in the year 2015, the statements of some of
the witnesses were recorded within four month of lodging the
same. But thereafter, the process became slow. The Letter
Rogatory was issued by the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate,
Kamrup, on 04/05/2016 and the same was sent to the Assistant
Director, International Police Co-operation Cell, CBI HQ, New Delhi
on 10/05/2016. But it transpires from the record that no
substantial development has taken place subsequently. There has
been series of communications including letters and e-mails at
various levels and from 10/05/2016 till date no substantial
investigation has been carried out. It is astonishing to note that
even video conference with the counterparts of the investigating
authority in the United States of America has not also taken
place. There is hardly any material to show that there have been
sincere efforts on the part of the authorities to send a team of
investigators to the United States of America for examination of
witnesses and to collect evidence and the investigation
apparently appears to have been confined to documents only. It
was incumbent upon the state machinery to ensure proper,
effective and unbiased investigation into the allegations made
in the first information report. This court totally fails to
understand as to why the investigation has been done at such a
Snail’s pace where prompt and effective action was_ wholly
warranted more so. when the allegations involve payment of

bribe by the said company to various government officials to
Page 4 of 6
the tune of Rs.6 crores approximately to win contract in Guwahati

valued at Rs.1452 crores.

10. It is now well settled by the Supreme Court that under
Article 226 of the Constitution, the High Court has the power to
direct an investigation by the C.B.I., but the power can be
exercised only in cases where there is sufficient material to come
to the prima facie conclusion that there is a need of such
investigation (See Secretary, Minor Irrigation and Rural
Engineering Services, U.P. Vs. Sahngoo Ram Arya, AIR 2002 SC
2225; Sakiri Vasu Vs. State of U.P.(2008) 2 SCC 409).

11. As enumerated herein above, it is crystal clear that the
investigating agency has not investigated the case in right earnest
and has been conducting the same in a partisan manner. The
mystery of such allegations involving misappropriation of
enormous public money must not haunt the people of the state
indefinitely and it must come to a logical end at the earliest.
Criminal Investigation Department (CID) is under the State
Government and since high ranking officials are involved in
awarding the contract after taking huge amount of bribe, we are
of the view that Criminal Investigation Department is not in a
position to act independently to bring the investigation to a fair
and logical conclusion in accordance with law. In this background,
we are of the view that the investigation of the case should not be
conducted by any investigating agency of the State Government
and there is a need for an investigation by the Central Bureau of

Investigation.

12. We, accordingly direct the Director, Central Bureau of
Investigation to take over the investigation of the case in question
from the CID and bring the investigation to its logical conclusion in
accordance with law. The case diary shall be submitted by the CID

in a sealed cover to the custody of Registrar General of this Court,

Page 5 of 6
who shall hand over the same, after completing necessary
formalities, to an officer authorized to receive it by the Director,
Central Bureau of Investigation. We also direct the State
Government and its police to cooperate fully with the Central

Bureau of Investigation in the investigation of the case.

14. With the above directions, the petition is allowed.

..Respondents
BEFORE
HON’BLE MR. Therefore, only respondent
No.2, who was then a minor, but by now has attained majority is the

only contesting respondent in this appeal. By this appeal under Section 299 of the Indian Succession Act,
1925, the appellant has challenged the judgment and decree dated
10.10.2002 passed by the learned District J udge, Karimganj in Title
Suit No.22/2001, which was an application under Section 221 of the
Succession Act for granting probate of Will stated to have been
executed by her son, Chira Ranjan Mukherjee, who expired on
22.09.1999. In the application for grant of probate, it was projected that
before the death of her son, the deceased was working as an
employee of Hindustan Paper Corporation Limited. Accordingly, the said application was filed claiming aggregate money
of GIS, CPF, financial assistance etc. The
appellant/ plaintiff examined 4 witnesses and the defendant side

examined 3 witnesses, who were duly cross examined by other side. Test Case No.1/2003 Page 2 of 9
3) Whether will of the testator is a valid one or it is a
collusive one? 4) Whether testator was deprived of his conjugal life
during life time? The learned trial court disbelieved the evidence of the
appellant/ plaintiff that Smt. Purnima Mukherjee was not the legally
married wife of the deceased. The evidence of PW.2 was also
doubted because as per his evidence, he stated that he saw the
testator for the first time when the Will was prepared and therefore,
the evidence of PW.2 was also doubted by the learned trial court. Moreover, his version was also doubted because as per the contents
of the Will (Exhbt.1), it was signed by the deceased after it was read
over by its writer but as per the evidence of PW.4, he put the

signature on the Will (Exhbt.1(4)) after the executor met him at
Test Case No.1/2003 Page 3 of 9
11/11:30 AM. Because as per the evidence of PW.2, at 11:30 PM the
executor met him to execute the Will. The circumstances of execution of Will was doubted because as per
the PW.1, the executor had handed over the Will to her on
17.09.1999, this was not correct because on 14.07.1999 when the
Will was prepared, as per records, the executor was in hospital and
therefore, the holding over of Will from 14.07.1999 to 17.09.1999
appeared to be doubtful when that period executor was in hospital. AA(1) to AA(5), which
IS Compared/true copy of the admission register of the hospital
where the deceased was admitted. The learned trial
court has noticed that the letter ‘r’ used in the word ‘Chira’ in the Will
was different from the other signatures which was proved vide
Exhbt. Kamlo Kimwar & others, AIR 1977 SC 63 and 3) Kalyan
Singh Vs. It is also submitted that
the evidence of PW.3 and PW.4 was unimpeachable to the effect
that the executor had met them at Bar Library in the District Court
on 14.07.1999 and the Will was executed and signed with sound
health and mind. Per contra, the learned counsel for the respondent has relied
on the findings recorded by the learned trial court and supported the
findings, according to him, the circumstance of execution of the Will
was extremely doubtful and therefore, there is no infirmity in the

appellant/plaintiff. According
to him, the contesting witness signed Exhbt.1 before him. Therefore, there is a discrepancy
as regards the time given by the PWs.2 & 3. As per the version of
PW.4, he had gone to the Bar Library at about 1:30 PM to 1:45 PM. Therefore, the state of
good mind and sound health of the executor of the Will was not
conducive for execution of the Will with free and sound mind.","THE GAUHATI HIGH COURT

For the respondent : Mr. RC Paul, Adv.

Date of hearing and judgment: 05.09.2017

JUDGMENT AND ORDER (ORAL)

Heard Mr. S. Dey, the learned counsel for the appellant as
well as Mr. RC Paul, the learned counsel for the sole respondent. It
is submitted that originally there were two respondents but the
respondent No.1 had died and her name was striked out by the order
dated 22.08.2017 passed by this Court. Therefore, only respondent
No.2, who was then a minor, but by now has attained majority is the

only contesting respondent in this appeal.

Test Case No.1/2003 Page 1of 9
2. By this appeal under Section 299 of the Indian Succession Act,
1925, the appellant has challenged the judgment and decree dated
10.10.2002 passed by the learned District J udge, Karimganj in Title
Suit No.22/2001, which was an application under Section 221 of the
Succession Act for granting probate of Will stated to have been
executed by her son, Chira Ranjan Mukherjee, who expired on
22.09.1999.

3. In the application for grant of probate, it was projected that
before the death of her son, the deceased was working as an
employee of Hindustan Paper Corporation Limited. As his
relationship with his wife (Smt. Purnima Mukherjee) was in trouble,
she left her son and used to reside at her parents’ house and
therefore, her deceased son, by making a last testament /Will on
14.07.1999 bequeathed all his property to the appellant herein.
Accordingly, the said application was filed claiming aggregate money
of GIS, CPF, financial assistance etc. lying with the employer
amounting to Rs.1,97,678/-. The application was duly verified by the
appellant and it was accompanied with a declaration of the witness,
who was the attesting witness to the will executed by the deceased.
The case was numbered as Misc.(Probate) No.83/2001 and as the
Original respondent No.1, namely, Anima Mukherjee had submitted
objection, and the case was converted to Title Suit No.22/2001. The
appellant/ plaintiff examined 4 witnesses and the defendant side

examined 3 witnesses, who were duly cross examined by other side.

4. Upon pleadings of the parties, the following issues were

framed by the learned trial court:

1) Whether the plaintiff has cause of action?

2) Whether the suit is maintainable?

Test Case No.1/2003 Page 2 of 9
3) Whether will of the testator is a valid one or it is a
collusive one?

4) Whether testator was deprived of his conjugal life
during life time?

5) Whether the plaintiff is entitled to relief she claims?

5. The learned District J udge took up issues No.1,2 & 3 together
and by discussing the evidence, doubted the execution of the Will.
The learned trial court disbelieved the evidence of the
appellant/ plaintiff that Smt. Purnima Mukherjee was not the legally
married wife of the deceased. It was held that the plaintiff had
made an admission in the probate petition that Purnima Mukherjee
was the wife of the appellant’s deceased son. On considering the
contents of family declaration (Exhbt. D) dated 17.12.1997 given to
the deceased by the employer, it was held that Purnima Mukherjee
was the wife of the deceased. It was further held that as per the
evidence of the plaintiff, except what was mentioned in the Will,
there was no other immovable property and therefore, it was
doubted that PW.1 did not know that what property was bequeathed
to her by her son. It was held that none of the witnesses stated
about the date of death of the son of the plaintiff. While, PW.2
stated that Will was prepared by him on 14.07.1999 but as per the
evidence of PW.3 and PW.4, it was their version that the date of
execution of Will was 17.07.1999. The evidence of PW.2 was also
doubted because as per his evidence, he stated that he saw the
testator for the first time when the Will was prepared and therefore,
the evidence of PW.2 was also doubted by the learned trial court.
Moreover, his version was also doubted because as per the contents
of the Will (Exhbt.1), it was signed by the deceased after it was read
over by its writer but as per the evidence of PW.4, he put the

signature on the Will (Exhbt.1(4)) after the executor met him at
Test Case No.1/2003 Page 3 of 9
11/11:30 AM. Because as per the evidence of PW.2, at 11:30 PM the
executor met him to execute the Will. Whereas as per the evidence
of PW.4, he had attended the Bar Library between 1:30 to 1:45 PM.
The circumstances of execution of Will was doubted because as per
the PW.1, the executor had handed over the Will to her on
17.09.1999, this was not correct because on 14.07.1999 when the
Will was prepared, as per records, the executor was in hospital and
therefore, the holding over of Will from 14.07.1999 to 17.09.1999
appeared to be doubtful when that period executor was in hospital.
The writing in Exhbt.1 (Will) was also doubtful because there was
over writing on the Will as regards the name of father of PW.3 and
therefore, there was a doubt whether the father of the said PW.3,
the attestator of the Will was alive or not at the time when the Will
was prepared. As per the evidence of PW.2, he did not give
categorical date of execution of Will and could not say how many
days after the release from hospital, the Will was executed although
the PW.3 was a close relative of the plaintiff. As per the evidence of
PW.1, father of the PW.3 died in Agrahayan, 2000 i.e.
November/December 2000, therefore the reference to the father of
PW.3 being alive or not was a source of doubtness as to the
genuineness of the Will because no one would refer to his living

father as dead.

6. The learned trial court relied on Exhbt. AA(1) to AA(5), which
IS Compared/true copy of the admission register of the hospital
where the deceased was admitted. Because as per the writing at
Exhbt. AA(4), the executor of the Will was in hospital from 4:00 PM
of 01.09.1999 to 10:00 AM on 15.09.1999 and therefore, on
14.07.1999 the execution of Will when said to be executed, whether
the executor was mentally and physically sound, was doubted by the

Test Case No.1/2003 Page 40f 9
learned trial court and held that in that circumstance when the
executor was in hospital from 16.06.1999 to 30.06.1999 and
16.08.1999 to 23.08.1999, 01.09.1999 to 15.09.1999 and again from
20.09.1999 to 22.09.1999, no person would be in appropriate
healthy state of body and mind to execute a Will. The learned trial
court has noticed that the letter ‘r’ used in the word ‘Chira’ in the Will
was different from the other signatures which was proved vide
Exhbt. B, C(1) and E(1) and therefore, this circumstances was held
to be doubtful. Therefore, the learned trial court by relying on the
cases of - 1) Surendra Paul and others Vs. Dr(Mrs.) Saraswati Arora
and another, AlR 1974 SC 1999, 2) Beni Chand (since dead) by LRs
Vs. Smt. Kamlo Kimwar & others, AIR 1977 SC 63 and 3) Kalyan
Singh Vs. Chhoti, AlR 1990 SC 367, held that Exhbt.1 , the Will was
not genuine one and it was also held that the Will ws collusive and
manipulated one and therefore, the plaintiff has no cause of action.
As regards, the issue No.4, it was held that Purnima Mukherjee did
not deprive the deceased from the enjoyment of conjugal life and
the said issue was also decided against the plaintiff and therefore, in
respect of issue No.5, it was held that plaintiff was not entitled to

any relief as prayed for.

7. The learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that the
learned trial court failed to consider the fact that the Will was duly
proved by PW.1 and other attesting witnesses as well as the scribe
and therefore, the judgment in the appeal was vitiated with material
irregularity and the same is not sustainable. It is also submitted that
the evidence of PW.3 and PW.4 was unimpeachable to the effect
that the executor had met them at Bar Library in the District Court
on 14.07.1999 and the Will was executed and signed with sound
health and mind. Therefore, the learned trial court had relied on

Test Case No.1/2003 Page 50f9
extraneous consideration to negate the appellant. The learned
counsel further submits that the signature of the executor in the
Exhbt.1 (the Will), was not disputed by anybody else and the learned
trial court did not call for any expert opinion on the signature of the
executor and, as such, there was no material before the learned
court to hold that the signature on the Will was doubtful. It is also
Submitted that from the contents of the Will, it is implied that the
executor had disinherited his wife and the beneficiaries of the Will,
being the mother, could not have been doubted by the learned trial

court.

8. Per contra, the learned counsel for the respondent has relied
on the findings recorded by the learned trial court and supported the
findings, according to him, the circumstance of execution of the Will
was extremely doubtful and therefore, there is no infirmity in the

judgment and decree impugned in the present appeal.

9. On the basis of the learned counsel for the parties, the

following point of determination arises in the present appeal:

“Whether the learned court below was correct in
doubting the circumstance on which Will was executed by the

executor, namely, Chira Ranjan Mukherjee?”

10. —_-In this connection, as a visual comparison of the signatures
appeared in the Exhbt.1 and the signatures of the executor appeared
in Exhbt. B(1), C(1), D(1), E(1) are sufficient to show that the
signature in Exhbt.1(1) of Chira Ranjan Mukherjee is quite different
from the one appearing in the other signatures mentioned above at
Exhbt.B(1) to E(1). It leaves this Court with no hesitation that the
findings recorded by the learned trial court as to the letter ‘r’

appeared in the name of ‘Chira’ is distinctly different from the
Test Case No.1/2003 Page 6 of 9
Signature in Exhbt.1(1) and the signatures in Exhbt. B(1) to E(1).
The other circumstances, which appears to be a clinching factors in
the present case is the endorsement made in the hospital admission
register. The executor, namely, Chira Ranjan Mukherjee shown to
be admitted at SI. No.338 at Bed No.M-4 having admitted on
01.09.1999 at about 4-00 PM and he was discharged at 10:00 AM on
15.09.1999. Therefore, an indoor patient in the hospital could not
have been said to be a fit person with good heath and sound mind
on the date i.e. 14.07.1999 when the alleged Will was executed at
the District Court at Karimganj. If the evidence of PW.2,3 & 4 are to
be believed that from 11:00 AM to 1:45 PM, the executor of the Will
was at the campus of the District Bar at Karimganj. He had also
gone at 7:00 AM to the house of PW.3. This appears to be not
possible because the hospital authority would definitely missed a
patient at the breakfast and lunch hour, when the patient were
required to be checked as indoor patient and if a patient is required
to go out, definitely there would be an entry to permit him to go out.
This fact has not’ been satisfactorily explained by the
appellant/plaintiff. The other factors, such as, mistake in the name
of the father of PW.3 and whether he was dead or alive when the
Will was executed on 14.07.1999 and other minor discrepancies
become a source of major doubts for which the court is required to

examine the circumstances under which will was prepared.

11. ‘It is also found to be surprising that at the time of crossexamination of the appellant/plaintiff, he was not aware of the exact
date when her son was admitted to hospital. As per the evidence of
PW.2, who admitted in Exhbt.1 that it was not endorsed when the
executor has put his signature after he perused the same. According
to him, the contesting witness signed Exhbt.1 before him. As per the

Test Case No.1/2003 Page 7 of 9
statement made by the said PW.2 in cross-examination, the executor
came to meet him at 12:00 noon. If the evidence of PW.3 was to be
believed, the executor had gone to his residence at 7:50 AM and
requested him to go to Karimganj at about 10:30 AM and therefore,
PW.3 was at the Bar Library at 10:30 AM and executor came to the
Bar Library at about 11-11:30 AM. Therefore, there is a discrepancy
as regards the time given by the PWs.2 & 3. As per the version of
PW.4, he had gone to the Bar Library at about 1:30 PM to 1:45 PM.
Therefore, a cumulative reading of evidence of PWs. 2,3 & 4, it
appears that the executor of the Will was absent from the hospital at
least at 7:30 AM and 11:00 AM to 1:45 PM in the afternoon, which,
according to this Court, Is a circumstance that creates doubt as to

the genuineness of the execution of the Will.

12. Therefore, the point of determination is answered against the
appellant by holding that the findings recorded by the learned trial
court on all issues No.1 to 5 appears to be correct and raise a
presumption that circumstances of preparation of the Will on
14.07.1999 was extremely doubtful and the execution of the Will on
14.07.1999 was doubtful because the executrix was admitted in
hospital from 01.09.1999 to 15.09.1999. Therefore, the state of
good mind and sound health of the executor of the Will was not
conducive for execution of the Will with free and sound mind. This
circumstance cannot be ignored and therefore, the doubt which

existed in the mind of the trial court is not found to be unfounded.

13. — In view of above, this Court does not find any infirmity in the
findings recorded by the trial court on the issues framed by the

learned District J udge, Karimganj.

Test Case No.1/2003 Page 8 of 9
14. Accordingly, the appeal stands dismissed and the impugned
judgment and decree dated 10.10.2002 passed by the learned
District J udge, Karimganj in Title Suit No.22/2001 of dismissing the

Suit, is confirmed. Cost awarded.
15. Let a Decree be prepared accordingly.

15. Let the LCR be returned forthwith.

as regards the time given by the PWs.2 & 3. As per the version of
PW.4, he had gone to the Bar Library at about 1:30 PM to 1:45 PM.
Therefore, a cumulative reading of evidence of PWs. 2,3 & 4, it
appears that the executor of the Will was absent from the hospital at
least at 7:30 AM and 11:00 AM to 1:45 PM in the afternoon, which,
according to this Court, Is a circumstance that creates doubt as to

the genuineness of the execution of the Will.

12. Therefore, the point of determination is answered against the
appellant by holding that the findings recorded by the learned trial
court on all issues No.1 to 5 appears to be correct and raise a
presumption that circumstances of preparation of the Will on
14.07.1999 was extremely doubtful and the execution of the Will on
14.07.1999 was doubtful because the executrix was admitted in
hospital from 01.09.1999 to 15.09.1999. Therefore, the state of
good mind and sound health of the executor of the Will was not
conducive for execution of the Will with free and sound mind. This
circumstance cannot be ignored and therefore, the doubt which

existed in the mind of the trial court is not found to be unfounded.

13. — In view of above, this Court does not find any infirmity in the
findings recorded by the trial court on the issues framed by the

learned District J udge, Karimganj.

For the petitioner(s): Mr. P.K. Deka, Mr. K.K. Dey, Mr. C. Baruah, Mr. M.R.
Adhikary, Mr. M. Dutta, Mr. R. Sarma, Mr. B. Sinha, Mr.
R.C. Paul, Mr. S. Alim, Mr. P.P. Borthakur, Mr. K.R.
Patgiri, Mr. H. Sarma, Ms. N. Upadhyay, and Mr. S.
Islam, Advocates. We understand that in
every district in the country video conferencing Is now available. ! Matrimonial cases where one of the parties resides outside court's
Jurisdiction is one of such categories. The advancement of technology ought to be utilized also for service on
parties or receiving communication from the parties. Every district court
must have at least one e-mail 1D. Administrative instructions for directions
can be issued to permit the litigants to access the court, especially when
litigant Is located outside the local jurisdiction of the Court. Order
incorporating such safeguards may be sent along with the summons. The
safeguards can be:
I) Availability of video conferencing facility. IV) E-mail address/phone number, if any, at which litigant from out

station may communicate. Records shall be sent by court where proceedings are pending to the
transferee court forthwith. The Registry to transmit a copy of this order to the courts concerned. They claim to be either dependent to their parents or their brothers
for their living. Page 6 of 32
d. The counsels have also asked this court to take notice of the
geographical situation of the State, further submitting that there are
three corners of the State and in order to travel from one corner of
the State to the other, it may take anything between 110-12 hours
to 24 hours by bus and by train. e. It was submitted that the court should also take note of female
literacy in the State as well as the educational background of the
wives in each case before permitting trail by video-conferencing. f. It is also submitted that if trial by video- conferencing is allowed, the
ladies would have to bear with double financial burden, one for one
set of counsel for representing them before the trial court, to file
pleadings, petitions, documents, argument, and another set of
counsels at the Town/ City/ Sub-Division, where there are presently
residing to give legal counselling and to guide them through the
entire proceedings, to prepare written statement, evidence- onaffidavits. Page 8 of 32
k. It is submitted that it would be equally risky for a lady to believe that
pleadings or petitions sent by post would reach the Court on time
and the office staff receiving post would promptly open postal
envelopes and tag such pleadings and petitions on record on the
date fixed. 8) Mr. PK Deka, the learned counsel for one of the petitioner has
Submitted that the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Krishna Veni
Nagam (supra) did not disturb the power and jurisdiction of this Court under
Section 24 CPC to transfer a suit from one court to another within its
jurisdiction in the State. He has submitted that the said judgment should be
considered to be prospective because of what was stated in paragraph-18
thereof. However, in his case, the summons stage was over and the trial
was going on. Moreover, the consistent views of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India as well as of the various High Court
including this Court that in respect of matrimonial cases, about the theory of
considering the convenience of wife had not been diluted in the case of

Krishna Veni Nagam (supra). 10) Mr. R. Sharma, the learned counsel appearing for one of the
petitioner has submitted that the husband is a police at the district of
Nagaon and therefore, he carries with him a clout in his hometown and
therefore, out of fear of the police husband, her witnesses may not be
inclined to give evidence at Nagaon and therefore, it is a fit case for transfer
of the proceeding to Tezpur in the district of Sonitpur. It is submitted
that it is a well settled law that procedural law is a handmade of justice. Therefore, the discretion which was hitherto available to the High Court
while deciding the application filed under Section 24 CPC is no longer
available and a question of law will arise whether in light of the direction
contained in the case of Krishna Veni Nagam (supra), whether this Court has
the power or jurisdiction to carve out any exception. He further submits that
all other cases including the case of Bharatiben Ravibhal (supra), cited by
the counsels for various petitioners can be distinguished from the ratio of the
case in Krishna Veni Nagam (supra), because all other cases are judgment in
personam, but judgment in the case of Krishna Veni Nagam (supra),
because of being circulated to all the High Courts, should be treated a
judgment in rem and it should be mandatorily treated as a direction under
Article 141 of the Constitution of India. 15) Having considered the arguments made by all the learned counsels
in all the cases, this Court would like to state that it is not aloof from the
realities of life and that it is insensitive with the various problems the wives
have to face once they were driven out from the matrimonial house and the
inevitable social stigma and financial and mental anxiety suffered by her to
maintain a litigation as well as to minor children, if any, born out of the
wedlock. Harish Nagam from J abalpur, Madhya Pradesh
to Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh. Hence, this Court is of the view
that in cases, where the wife has reservations from trial on videoconferencing, it would be just and proper to transfer the proceedings from

one place to another, instead of compelling a trial by video-conferencing. There are no provisions of sending petitions by e-mail
and for its acceptance by Courts. 18) Moreover, in some cases, where there are pending litigations
between the parties in the place where the wife is residing as was the facts
In the case of Bharatiben Ravibhai (supra), where there was a pending
litigation at Dungarpur (Rajasthan), for which the matrimonial proceedings
was transferred or in one of the present case in hand, where the husband Is
a police personnel and the wife apprehends threat. /t Is
certainly difficult in video conferencing, if not impossible, to maintain
confidentiality. 77/2017 from the Court
of Principal J udge, Family Court, Kamrup (M), Guwahati to the Court
of Principal Judge, Family Court, Silchar. She is a Doctor and
associated with works of National Rural Health Mission. 17/2016,

pending before the learned Court of District Judge, Bongaigaon,
which is a petition under Section 13(1)(i-a) and (i-b) of Hindu
Marriage Act, 1955, seeking dissolution of marriage by divorce and
other reliefs. Therefore, considering the un-denied
statement that the petitioner is contesting Misc. 17/2016,
pending before the learned Court of District J udge, Bongaigaon. The
respondent- wife has contested this application by filing Affidavit- inOpposition, claiming that the decree of divorce was obtained by
fraud. 148/2015 that the respondent has not been paid
any alimony or maintenance. Therefore, this court finds that this is not a
fit case for transfer of the proceeding. With the aforesaid observation, this application stands dismissed. It is stated that the
respondent Is a police personnel and has sufficient clout at Nagaon,
which is an intimidating factor for the petitioner to produce her
witnesses at Nagaon. It is submitted that she has recently joined as
a Teacher in Tezpur Govt. No one has
entered appearance for the respondent although notice was served
on his police station. 3262/16 is stated to be pending before
the learned Court of Chief J udicial Magistrate, Tezpur, this court is of
the view that the ratio of the case Bharatiben Ravibhal Rav (supra) \s
applicable. In this regard, it would be the duty of the petitioner to
produce a certified copy of this order before the learned Court of
District J udge, Nagaon for transfer of the said proceedings. As the
respondent herein has not entered appearance, the learned Court of
District Judge, Nagaon, shall fix the date of appearance of the
respondent (i.e. petitioner in T.S.(R) 72/16) before the learned Court
of District J udge, Sonitpur on 03.11.2017. The petitioner has prayed for transfer of the said case from
the learned Court of District Judge, Jorhat to the learned Court of
District J udge, Hojai. It is submitted that the petitioner had filed an
application under section 12 of the Protection of Women from
Domestic Violence Act, 2005, being D.V. Case No. It is submitted
that the T.S. (M) 7/2017 was filed to harass her. The learned District J udge,
Hojai, would be at liberty to transfer the case before any other

competent Court for trial. The
petitioner has prayed for transfer of the said case from the learned
Court of District Judge, Barpeta to the learned Court of Principal
Judge, Family Court, Kamrup (M), Guwahati. She was again compelled
to take shelter in her parental home and she filed F.C.(Crl) Case No. Considering the statement that the
petitioner is having no source of income and no one to escort her to
attend court proceedings at Barpeta, this Court is inclined to transfer
the proceedings of T.S. (M) 8/2017 from the learned Court of District
Judge, Barpeta to the learned Court of Principal J udge, Family Court,
Kamrup (M), Guwahati. It is
Submitted that the petitioner has no independent source of income
and has no one to escort her to Tinsukia. Therefore, in this case, this
Court finds that the ratio of the case Bharatiben Ravibhal Rav
(supra) is found to be applicable. The learned District Judge, Lakhimpur, North Lakhimpur,
would be at liberty to transfer the case before any other competent

Court (if any) for trial. Sri Subir Maitra - The petitioner/

wife is the defendant in T.S. (M) No. Considering the said statements this Court Is inclined to transfer the
proceedings of T.S. (M) No. 748/2016 under Section 13(1)(i-a) of the Hindu
Marriage Act, 1955 for dissolution of marriage. The petitioner has
prayed for transfer of the said case from the learned Court of
Principal J udge, Family Court, Kamrup (M), Guwahati to the learned
Court of District Judge, Jorhat. The parties, who are represented by their respective learned
counsels are directed to appear in person or through duly instructed

attend the Court proceedings.","THE GAUHATI HIGH COURT

the learned Counsels appearing for the respondents herein.

2) These petitions have been filed under Section 24 of the Civil
Procedure Code, by which cases relating to matrimonial disputes and/or
Guardianship dispute pending in various courts are sought to be transferred

from one District to another.

3) The reason for hearing all the matters together was deemed
necessitated in view of the recent judgment delivered by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India in the case of Krishna Veni Nagam vs. Harish Nagam
reported in (2017) 4 SCC 150. This judgment has been circulated to this
Court by the Registry of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. It would be

relevant to refer to paragraphs -13 to 20 thereof, which is extracted below:

“13. We have considered the above suggestions. /n this respect, we may
also refer to the doctrine of forum non conveniens which can be applied in
matrimonial proceedings for advancing interest of justice. Under the said
doctrine, the court exercises its inherent jurisdiction to stay proceedings at
a forum which Is considered not to be convenient and there is any other
forum which Is considered to be more convenient for the interest of all the
parties at the ends of justice. !1n Moai Entertainment Network and anr. Vv.
W.S.G. Cricket Pte. Ltal[(2003) 4 SCC 341] this Court observed:

“19. In Soiliada Maritime case[Soiliada Maritime Coron. V.
Cansulex Ltd, (1986) 3 All ER 843: 1987 AC 460 : (1986) 3 WLR
972(HL)] the House of Lords laid down the following jrinaple:

‘The fundamental princiole applicable to both the stay of
English proceedings on the ground that some other forum was the
appropriate forum and also the grant of leave to serve proceedings
out of the jurisdiction was that the court would choose that forum
in Which the case could be tried more suitably for the interest of all
the parties and for the ends of justice......”

The criteria to determine which was a more approorniate forum, for
the purpose of ordering stay of the suit, the court would look for
that forum with which the action had the most real and substantial
connection in terms of convenience or expense, availability of
witnesses, the law governing the relevant transaction and the
places where the parties resided or carried on business. If the court

Page 3 of 32
concluded that there was no other available forum which was more
appropriate than the English court, it would normally refuse a stay.
/f, however, the court concluded that there was another forum
Which was prima facie more appropriate, the court would normally
grant a stay unless there were arcumstances militating against a
Stay. /t was noted that as the alsoute concerning the contract in
Which the proper law was English law, it meant that England was
the appropriate forum in which the case could be more suitably
tried.”

Though these observations have been made in the context of
granting anti suit injunction, the principle can be followed in regulating the
exerase of jurisdiction of the court where proceedings are instituted. /n a
avil proceeding, the plaintiff is the dominus /itis but if more than one court
has jurisdiction, court can determine which Is the convenient forum and lay
down conaitions in the interest of justice subject to which its jurisdiction
may be availed. [Kusum Ingots & Alloys Lta. v. Union of India, (2004) 6 SCC
254, pata-30].

14, One cannot ignore the problem faced by a husband if proceedings are
transferred on account of genuine difficulties faced by the wife. The
husband may find it difficult to contest proceedings at a place which Is
convenient to the wife. Thus, transfer is not always a solution acceotable to
both the parties. !t may be appropriate that available technology of video
conferencing Is used where both the parties have egual difficulty and there
Is no place which is convenient to both the parties. We understand that in
every district in the country video conferencing Is now available. !n any
case, Wherever such facility is available, it ought to be fully utilized and all
the High Courts ought to issue appropriate administrative instructions to
regulate the use of video conferencing for certain category of cases.
Matrimonial cases where one of the parties resides outside court's
Jurisdiction is one of such categories. Wherever one or both the parties
make a request for use of video conference, proceedings may be conducted
on video conferencing, obviating the needs of the party to appear in person.
/n several cases, this Court has directed recording of evidence by video
conferencing. [State of Maharashtra v. Praful B. Desai, (2003) 4 SCC 601:
2003 SCC (Cri) 815; Kalyan Chandra Sarkar v. Rajesh Ranjan, (2005) 3 SCC
284; 2005 SCC (Cri) 705; Budhadev Karmaskar (4) v. State of W.B., (2011)
10 SCC 283 : (2012) 1 SCC (Cr) 285; Malthesh Gudda Pooja v. State of
Karnataka, (2011) 15 SCC 330: (2014) 2 SCC (Civ) 473].

15. The other difficulty faced by the parties living beyond the local
Jurisdiction of the court Is ignorance about availability of suitable legal
services. Legal Aid Committee of every district ought to make available
selected panel of advocates whose discipline and quality can be suitably
regulated and who are ready to provide legal aid at a specitied fee. Such
panels ought to be notified on the websites of the District Legal Services
Authorities/State Legal Services Authorities/National Legal Services
Authority. This may enhance access to justice consistent with Article 39A of
the Constitution.

16. The advancement of technology ought to be utilized also for service on
parties or receiving communication from the parties. Every district court
must have at least one e-mail 1D. Administrative instructions for directions
can be issued to permit the litigants to access the court, especially when
litigant Is located outside the local jurisdiction of the Court. A designated
officer/manager of a district court may suitably respond to such e-mail in

Page 4 of 32
the manner permitted as per the administrative instructions. Similarly, a
manager/ information officer in every alstrict court may be accessible on a
notified teleohone during notified hours as per the instructions. These steos
may, to some extent, take care of the problems of the litigants. These
suggestions may need attention of the High Courts.

17. We are thus of the view that it is necessary to issue certain directions
Which may provide alternative to seeking transfer of proceedings on
account of inability of a party to contest proceedings at a place away from
their ordinary residence on the ground that if proceedings are not
transferred it will result in denial of justice.

18 We, therefore direct that in matrimonial or custody matters or in
proceedings between parties to a marriage or arising out of adlsoutes
between parties to a marriage, wherever the defendants/ respondents are
located outside the jurisdiction of the court, the court where proceedings
are instituted may examine whether it Is in the interest of justice to
Incorporate any safeguards for ensuring that summoning” of
defendant/resoondent does not result in denial of Justice. Order
incorporating such safeguards may be sent along with the summons. The
safeguards can be:
I) Availability of video conferencing facility.

Il) Availability of legal aid service.

iii) Deoosit of cost for travel, lodging and boarding in terms of Order
XXV CPC.

IV) E-mail address/phone number, if any, at which litigant from out

station may communicate.

19. We hope the above arrangement may, to an extent, reduce hardship to
the litigants as noted above in the Order of this Court dated 9th /anuary,
2017. However, in the present case since the matter is pending in this Court
for about three years, we are satisfied that the prayer for transfer may be
allowed. Accordingly, we direct that proceedings in Case No.179A4/2013
under Section 13 of the Act titled “Harish Nagam vs. Krishna Veni Nagam”
pending on the file of 11 Presiding Judge, Family Court, /abalour, Madhya
Pradesh shall stand transferred to the Family Court, Hyderabad, Andhra
Pradesh. /f the parties seek meatation the transferee court may explore the
possibility of an amicable settlement through mediation. 1t will be open to
the transferee court to conduct the proceedings or record evidence of the
witnesses who are unable to appear in court by way of video conferencing.
Records shall be sent by court where proceedings are pending to the
transferee court forthwith.

20. The Registry to transmit a copy of this order to the courts concerned. A
copy of this order be sent to all the High Courts for aooropriate action.”

Page 5 of 32
4) On enquiry, this Court has been informed that save and except four
districts of Assam, viz., N.C. Hills Autonomous District, Karbi Anglong
Autonomous District, Baska District and Chirang District, all other District
Courts have already set up with Video Conference facilities. Under the
aforesaid background, this Court deems fit that analogous hearing of this
cases be taken up so that there can be a threadbare discussion on the
matter. The various counsels for the petitioner’s side had voiced their
grievance regarding the adoptability of the Video Conference facilities for the
common public in the State of Assam, for which, the learned counsels for all
the petitioners had argued in favour of transfer of the matrimonial
proceedings instead of compelling the petitioners to accept the Video

Conference facility for trial of cases.

5) The following causes for their concern have been cited by the
learned counsels for the petitioners 
a. It is submitted that by and large in all cases, the wives who are in
distress and who were either driven out from the matrimonial home
or compelled to leave their matrimonial homes for variety of reasons,
are the petitioners herein. The petitioners have prayed for transfer of
the proceedings to the place where they are presently residing.

b. In majority of cases, the distressed wife, has no earning capacity.
They claim to be either dependent to their parents or their brothers
for their living. In many cases, the wives are also burdened to take
care of their minor children, their education and healthy growth, etc.
It is claimed that in many cases, the issue of maintenance have not
been settled, and even if any maintenance is allowed from their
estranged husband, the money awarded is a mere pittance, which is
not sufficient to take decent care of themselves, not to speak of
minor children.

c. It is submitted that being females, they have to face a great
difficulty to travel from their parental home to attend the Court in a

distant place away from their residence.

Page 6 of 32
d. The counsels have also asked this court to take notice of the
geographical situation of the State, further submitting that there are
three corners of the State and in order to travel from one corner of
the State to the other, it may take anything between 110-12 hours
to 24 hours by bus and by train. It is also submitted that few
Districts of the State stay inundated by flood water for 1-2 months in
a year for which normal life is disrupted for a total of 3-4 months
due to the annual calamity of flood. During these times, females not
only feel insecure for travelling alone in nigh-super and in trains, but
during these times of distress, as the male members of their parental
family are already having difficult times, they cannot spare time to
escort the females to court at a distant place.

e. It was submitted that the court should also take note of female
literacy in the State as well as the educational background of the
wives in each case before permitting trail by video-conferencing. It is
submitted that the uneducated and not too much technology savvy
ladies would find it difficult to conduct a trial under Video
Conferencing unless they are assisted by the equally tech-savvy
counsel. The ladies, who are left to be deprived without any legal
Support would find it very difficult to conduct a trial in Video
Conferencing.

f. It is also submitted that if trial by video- conferencing is allowed, the
ladies would have to bear with double financial burden, one for one
set of counsel for representing them before the trial court, to file
pleadings, petitions, documents, argument, and another set of
counsels at the Town/ City/ Sub-Division, where there are presently
residing to give legal counselling and to guide them through the
entire proceedings, to prepare written statement, evidence- onaffidavits. She would have to keep constant touch with both sets of
the counsel to keep herself updated about the dates posted in the

case and to monitor the date-wise progress of the case.

Page 7 of 32
g. It is submitted that even if trial is conducted by video-conferencing,
there is no denial that the lady would still be compelled to travel
from time to time to the town where the trial is taking place for the
purpose of paying fees of the counsel as well as for filing various
petitions requiring swearing of affidavit in support of the petitions,
unless this court completely waives the requirement of filing
petitions with original signature.

h. It is urged that a lady, who is financially starved and facing social
stigma connected with a lady whose husband has left her, and lack
of support from her own parental family, such a lady would be lucky
if she can engaged advocates at both her nearest court as well as
the town where litigation is filed. 1t would be still difficult to organize
two sets of unknown counsel to work in the tandem with each other
with the required coordination, because if the two sets of lawyers do
not coordinate with each other then, there are no chances of getting
a fair trial. There is a remote chance that a lady may get the service
of a counsel, who Is willing to take assignment only a date wise basis
without any continuity of engagement, because it is a common
practice that counsel is engaged for the entire life of litigation, and
no good counsel with some reputation would consent to take steps
only on as and when occasion arises. Therefore, if videoconferencing is allowed, there would be additional financial burden
on the wife to engage counsel at two different places, keep travelling
to and fro.

I. It is submitted that every lady is not staying in Towns/ City/ SubDivisional Towns, some of them would have to travel some distance
from their villages to reach the nearest Court having Videoconferencing facilities.

j. It is further argued that it would be a risky affair for a lady to send
the original documents by post to the town where litigation is going

on as it may get lost during transit.

Page 8 of 32
k. It is submitted that it would be equally risky for a lady to believe that
pleadings or petitions sent by post would reach the Court on time
and the office staff receiving post would promptly open postal
envelopes and tag such pleadings and petitions on record on the
date fixed. Therefore, unless the lady can successfully interact with
Presiding Officer of Court at around 10.30 am, she would not know
what would happen to her case in course of the day. Without
permitting interaction at a fixed time, no court would adjourn a case
merely because of postal delay.

|. The ground reality of lack of uninterrupted electricity supply, lack of
uninterrupted internet connectivity must also be addressed, as to
what would happen if on a particular day, due to mobile link failure,
electricity failure and internet link failure a remote station litigant
cannot get connected even over mobile phone to inform Court
Managers about internet/ mobile link failure. Examples were cited of
link failure in banks which stops all transactions including ATM
transactions, connectivity problems faced while e-filing of Income
Tax returns and GST returns in recent times, which became news

headlines.

6) It is also submitted that the judgment in Krishna Veni Nagam (supra)
was by a Division Bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, which had not overruled various orders by co-ordinate Bench of equal strength, whereby the
Hon’ble Supreme Court had deemed it fit to transfer matrimonial cases in the
place of choice of the wife. It is submitted that if permitted, they are ready
to refer to many cases where such cases were transferred. Hence, they
Submit that the case of Krishna Veni Nagarnisupora) should be treated as a
judgment per-incurium, which had not taken note of the previous orders by
co-ordinate Benches of equal strength, allowing transfer of matrimonial

CaSes.

Page 9 of 32
7) All the counsels for the petitioners’ side are unison in submitting that
trial by video- conferencing may be possible for some of the parties, but by
and large, unless such trial is started at an experimental basis in one or two
given case where parties are consenting, the permitting all trial by videoconferencing may not be the ideal solution for the State of Assam, which is
technologically not so advanced like metropolitan cities like Mumbai and New
Delhi.

8) Mr. PK Deka, the learned counsel for one of the petitioner has
Submitted that the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Krishna Veni
Nagam (supra) did not disturb the power and jurisdiction of this Court under
Section 24 CPC to transfer a suit from one court to another within its
jurisdiction in the State. He has submitted that the said judgment should be
considered to be prospective because of what was stated in paragraph-18
thereof. It is submitted that in this particular paragraph -18, the Hon’ble
Supreme Court was referring to incorporate safeguard for ensuring that
Summoning of defendants /respondents does not result in denial of justice
and therefore, ordered for safeguards to be mentioned while issuing of
Summonses. However, in his case, the summons stage was over and the trial
was going on. By citing various cases, where various High Courts in the
Country as well as the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India had transferred
matrimonial proceedings to the city/town where the wife was residing. He
specifically relies on the following four cases:

a. Rabinatra Kaur v. /itendra Singh, AlR 2000 SC 3403.

b. Sumita Singh Vs. Kumar Sanjay, AlR 2002 SC 396.

Cc. Durga Panalit Vs. Pradio Kumar Pandit, (2004) 1 GLT 440.

a. Pallavi Saikia Vs. Mriganka Bharall, (2006) SUPP GLT 425.

9) Mr. B. Chakraborty, the learned counsel appearing for one of the
petitioner has submitted that the case of Krishna Veni Nagam (suora) may
not be made applicable in these cases, firstly, because the Hon’ble Supreme

Court was passing an order under Section 25 CPC and it was not deciding

Page 10 of 32
the matter under Section 24 CPC. Moreover, the consistent views of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India as well as of the various High Court
including this Court that in respect of matrimonial cases, about the theory of
considering the convenience of wife had not been diluted in the case of

Krishna Veni Nagam (supra).

10) Mr. R. Sharma, the learned counsel appearing for one of the
petitioner has submitted that the husband is a police at the district of
Nagaon and therefore, he carries with him a clout in his hometown and
therefore, out of fear of the police husband, her witnesses may not be
inclined to give evidence at Nagaon and therefore, it is a fit case for transfer
of the proceeding to Tezpur in the district of Sonitpur. He also relies on the
case of Bharatiben Ravibhal Rav Vs. Ravibhal Govindbhal Rav decided on
05.05.2017 and reported in (2017) 6 SCC 785 to project that in the said
case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court did not deem it fit to permit Video
Conference and transfer the case from one district to another for the
convenience of wife and also considering the fact that when another
proceeding is pending between the parties in the courts where the wife is
residing and in this connection, he has submitted that at present three

separate proceedings initiated by the wife is currently pending at Tezpur.

11) Per contra, arguing in support of the idea of trial by video
conferencing, it is submitted that it is equally true for the husband to travel
to the place of choice of the wife and to face trial at a distant place. It is
Submitted that the husband are engaged in some service, profession,
business or other vocation to earn his livelihood. While it would not be
inconvenient for the wife to travel, if she is unemployed, but it would be very
difficult for the husband to avail leave to travel to attend matrimonial cases,
which is likely to affect the service carrier, business, profession or vocation.
It is submitted that in appropriate cases, if the problem faced by the wife is

genuine, the courts may, on case to case basis, order a reasonable cost of

Page 11 of 32
litigation, travel, lodging and food for the wife, children (if any), and an

escort.

12) Mr. Sishir Dutta, the learned senior counsel for one of the
respondent has referred to the case of MN. Murthy v. State of Karnataka,
(2003) 7 SCC 514 to argue that unless the order specifically provides for
prospective overruling, all judgments are deemed to have retrospective
effect and, as such, the argument by the learned counsel for the petitioners
that the case of Krishna Veni Nagam (supra) Nas prospective application is
not sustainable in view of the ratio laid down in the case of MN Murthy

(supra).

13) Mr. Saurav Kataki, the learned counsel for one of the respondent has
Submitted that Section 24 CPC is a procedural law and therefore, in a strict
sense, Section 24 is not a statutory law but a procedural law. It is submitted
that it is a well settled law that procedural law is a handmade of justice.
However, when the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India has given a direction as
to what procedure should be adopted in case of transfer of matrimonial suit,
In that case, the said decision becomes a law binding on all Courts and
Tribunals under the provisions of Article 141 of the Constitution of India.
Therefore, the discretion which was hitherto available to the High Court
while deciding the application filed under Section 24 CPC is no longer
available and a question of law will arise whether in light of the direction
contained in the case of Krishna Veni Nagam (supra), whether this Court has
the power or jurisdiction to carve out any exception. He further submits that
all other cases including the case of Bharatiben Ravibhal (supra), cited by
the counsels for various petitioners can be distinguished from the ratio of the
case in Krishna Veni Nagam (supra), because all other cases are judgment in
personam, but judgment in the case of Krishna Veni Nagam (supra),
because of being circulated to all the High Courts, should be treated a
judgment in rem and it should be mandatorily treated as a direction under
Article 141 of the Constitution of India.

Page 12 of 32
14) All the learned counsels for the parties have argued their respective
arguments but their submissions are consonance with the submission
already recorded above, it is not deemed necessary to reiterate those

arguments to burden this order.

15) Having considered the arguments made by all the learned counsels
in all the cases, this Court would like to state that it is not aloof from the
realities of life and that it is insensitive with the various problems the wives
have to face once they were driven out from the matrimonial house and the
inevitable social stigma and financial and mental anxiety suffered by her to
maintain a litigation as well as to minor children, if any, born out of the
wedlock. However, the majority of objections raised by the learned counsels
for the petitioners appeared to be answered by the Hon’ble Supreme Court
of India in pargarphs-14 to 18 of the case of Krishna Veni Nagam (supra),

which are already extracted above.

16) However, it must be noted that even in the case of Krishna Veni
Nagam (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India deemed it fit to transfer
the case of the husband, |.e. Harish Nagam from J abalpur, Madhya Pradesh
to Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh. Therefore, the question arises, that when
the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the said case of Krishna Veni Nagam
(supra), did not deem it fit not to transfer the matrimonial proceedings by
ordering trial by video-conferencing, and when the Hon'ble Supreme Court of
India in the subsequent case of Bharatiben Ravibhal Rav (supra), where the
matrimonial proceedings was transferred from Ahmedabad (Gujrat) to
Dungarpur (Rajasthan), there is no doubt that the Hon’ble Supreme Court of
India deemed it fit to exclude some cases from video-conferencing, where
the parties did not consent for such trial. Hence, this Court is of the view
that in cases, where the wife has reservations from trial on videoconferencing, it would be just and proper to transfer the proceedings from

one place to another, instead of compelling a trial by video-conferencing.

Page 13 of 32
17) This court has also taken note of the practical problems and
difficulties expressed by the learned counsels for the petitioners. To mention
a few, there is no provision under the Gauhati High Court Rules as well as
Civil Court Rules & Orders of the Gauhati High Court relating to trial by
video-conferencing. There are no provisions of sending petitions by e-mail
and for its acceptance by Courts. There is no provision to empower a trial
court to defer the proceedings merely because it receives communication
over phone call to Court Manager of by e-mail that pleadings or petitions had
been despatched by post. The subordinate Court staffs have not been
sensitized to promptly open postal envelopes and urgently tag the petitions
received by post in court record and to place them before the Court. The
Presiding Officers of the Courts are not yet sensitized to wait till such time in
the day till postal service is usually made to court premises, for which there
is every possibility that a court may pass orders in first half of the day and
the postal delivery containing petitions and pleadings being received after
orders are passed. There is no provisions in Gauhati High Court Rules as well
as Civil Court Rules & Orders of the Gauhati High Court about what would
happen if a party agreeing for trial by video-conference sends a pleading,
petition or document by post and the postal envelope is misplaced and what
would be the procedure for reconstruction of documents not received by
court, but lost in postal transit. There are no provisions in the Gauhati High
Court Rules as well as Civil Court Rules & Orders of the Gauhati High Court
to make a Court Manager as an agent for the out-station litigant, so as to
enable the Courts to accept submissions made by a Court Manager on the
basis of telephonic message or e-mail received from a litigant, and to pass
orders on the basis of any submissions made before the Court. The
procedure of regular trial by Video-conferencing, in the opinion of this court,
must be incorporated in the appropriate Rules governing trial like Gauhati
High Court Rules as well as Civil Court Rules & Orders of the Gauhati High
Court, because it is one thing to have an occasional session by Video
Conferencing like delivering judgment, one or two session of cross
Page 14 of 32
examination of accused who for various reasons like internal security, or to
maintain peace and tranquillity, is not desired to be moved from prison, or
video-conferencing with a hospitalized person, periodical viewing of undertrial accused lodged in jail by concerned Magistrates, etc., to name a few.
Therefore, it is hoped that in future, some of the issues are addressed by
this Court so that appropriate Rules are framed for facilitating video
conferencing, aS suggested by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India.

18) Moreover, in some cases, where there are pending litigations
between the parties in the place where the wife is residing as was the facts
In the case of Bharatiben Ravibhai (supra), where there was a pending
litigation at Dungarpur (Rajasthan), for which the matrimonial proceedings
was transferred or in one of the present case in hand, where the husband Is
a police personnel and the wife apprehends threat. This Court cannot shut

its eyes to such practical ground realities.

19) Moreover, it has come to the notice of this Court that the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India in the case of Santhini Vs. Vijaya Venketesh by an
order dated 09.08.2017 (Para-19), has referred the case of Krishna Veni
Nagam (supra) to the Hon’ble The Chief J ustice of India to consider referring
the said case before a larger Bench. The outcome of such reference is not

known. The relevant para of the said order is quoted below:
‘19. To what extent the confidence and confidentiality will be
safeguarded and protected in video conferencing, particularly when
efforts are taken by the counsellors, welfare experts, and for that
matter, the court itself for reconciliation, restitution of conjugal rights
or alssolution of marriage, ascertainment of the wishes of the child in
custody matters, etc, Is a serious issue to be considered. /t Is
certainly difficult in video conferencing, if not impossible, to maintain
confidentiality. It has also to be noted that the footage in video
conterenang becomes part of the record whereas the reconciiatory
efforts taken by the duty-holders referred to above are not meant to
be part of the record. All that aoart, in reconciiatory efforts, physical
presence of the parties would make a significant difference. Having
regard to the very object behind the establishment of Family Courts
Act, 1984, to Order XXXIIA of the Code of Civil Procedure and to the

Page 15 of 32
soedal provisions introduced in the Hindu Marriage Act under
Sections 22, 23 and 26, we are of the view that the airections Issued
by this Court in Krishna Veni Nagam (supra) need reconsideration on
the aspect of video conferencing in matrimonial disputes. ”

20) Therefore, in the overall view of the matter, as the case of Krishna
Veni Nagam (supra) does not lay down a law prohibiting transfer of any case
and instead follow the course of trial by video-conferencing, this court is of
the view that until some provisions are made in the Gauhati High Court Rules
as well as Civil Court Rules & Orders of the Gauhati High Court in respect of
full trial by video-conferencing, it would not be in the interest of the litigants
of the State of Assam to mandatorily undertake a full length trial by videoconferencing as an alternative of transfer of suits. The provisions of Section
24 CPC having not been struck-off, the power of this Court to exercise
jurisdiction under Section 24 CPC to transfer suits and proceedings cannot be
taken away in appropriate cases. In light of the various orders passed by the
Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in the various cases referred herein before,
with greatest respect to the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India, as the case of
Krishna Vent Nagam (supra) is under reconsideration of the said Hon'ble
Court and as even in the said judgment, the matrimonial case was indeed
transferred from Jabalpur to Hyderabad, in the absence of law laid down
curtailing the power of this Court to exercise jurisdiction under Section 24
CPC, this court is inclined to continue to exercise jurisdiction under Section
24 CPC.

21) With the aforesaid observations, the individual cases are now taken

up:
. IPPC) No. 14/2017 - Smt. Subarna Bhattacharjee Vs. Sri

Siddartha Biswas - \n this case, the petitioner- wife is seeking
transfer of proceedings of F.C.(C) Case No. 77/2017 from the Court
of Principal J udge, Family Court, Kamrup (M), Guwahati to the Court
of Principal Judge, Family Court, Silchar. She is a Doctor and
associated with works of National Rural Health Mission. She has a

Page 16 of 32
minor baby. Petitioner has no brother, but lives with aged parents.
She claims that marriage was solemnized at Silchar and after
marriage, she was living in their matrimonial home and Kolkata and
the case was filed at Guwahati to harass her and the Court at
Guwahati had no jurisdiction. In the affidavit in opposition, the
respondent has not denied that after marriage at Silchar, their
matrimonial home was not at Kolkata. Therefore, this court deems it
fit to transfer the proceedings of F.C.(C) Case No. 77/2017 from the
Court of Principal J udge, Family Court, Kamrup (M), Guwahati to the
Court of Principal J udge, Family Court, Silchar. The learned Court of
Principal J udge, Family Court, Kamrup (M), Guwahati shall transfer
the records of F.C.(C) Case No. 77/2017 to the Court of Principal
Judge, Family Court, Silchar. In this regard, it would be the duty of
the petitioner to produce a certified copy of this order before the
Court of Principal Judge, Family Court, Kamrup (M), Guwahati for
transfer of the said proceedings.

The parties, who are represented by their counsel, shall appear
before the Court of Principal J udge, Family Court, Cachar, Silchar, on
03.11.2017 without any further notice for appearance and by
producing certified copy of this order, shall seek further instruction

from the said learned Court.

7r.P.(C) No. 11/2017 - Maya Das (Thapa) Vs. Dipankar Das 
In this case, the petitioner/wife is the defendant in FC (Civil) Case
No.309/16 pending before the learned Principal J udge, Family Court,
Silchar, Cachar, which is a petition under Section 9 of the Hindu
Marriage Act, 1955. The petitioner has prayed for transfer of the
case from the Court of learned Principal J udge, Family Court, Cachar,
Silchar to the court of learned Principal Judge, Family Court at
Dimapur, Nagaland. In this case, this Court finds that this is a case
for the transfer from one State to another. In this regard, this Court

in the case of Porm Sengupta vs. Biswaj/it Senguota, (2015) 6 GLR

Page 17 of 32
396; (2016) 1 GLT 627, had discussed the jurisdiction of the Court
under Section 24 CPC and had laid down that this Court does not
have jurisdiction to make inter-State transfer of the suites and
proceedings. Therefore, such transfer, in the considered opinion of
this Court can only be made under Section 25 CPC. Therefore, by
following the precedent of the case of Porn’ Sengupta (supra), this
Court is not inclined to transfer the suit to outside the State although
Subordinate courts in the State of Nagaland are within the
jurisdiction of this Court, but still, it lies outside the State of Assam.
The parties, who are represented by their counsel, shall appear
before the Court of Principal J udge, Family Court, Cachar, Silchar, on
03.11.2017 without any further notice for appearance and by
producing certified copy of this order, shall seek further instruction

from the said learned Court.

7r.P.(C) No. 80/2016 - Mrs. Queen Hazarika Gogol Vs. Sri
Uttam Gogol - \n this case, the petitioner/wife is the defendant in

Misc. Case (G) No.1/15 pending before the court of learned District
Judge, Dibrugarh, which is a petition under Section 10 of the
Guardians and Wards Act, 1890. The petitioner has prayed for
transfer of the case from the court of learned District Judge,
Dibrugarh to the court of learned District Judge, Sivasagar. The
respondent/husband herein is reported to be a police personnel
serving aS a constable and the minor child (aged 4 years and 5
months, aS no 16.02.2015, the date of filing of the guardianship
petition) is now residing with the petitioner/wife. Moreover, the
petitioner has claimed that she has become entitled to receive
maintenance from the husband as per the order passed by the
learned Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Nazira in Misc. Case
No.2/2014 filed under Section 125 Cr.P.C. (at one place also
mentioned as order passed by the learned Munsiff-cuny] udicial

Magistrate, First Class, Nazira). It appears that the respondent had

Page 18 of 32
also instituted Criminal Revision No.8(1)/2015 before the learned
Sessions J udge, Sivasagar. Therefore, in this case, this Court finds
that the ratio of the case Bharatiben Ravibhai Rav (supra) is found to
be applicable. Therefore, the proceedings of the Misc. Case (G)
No.1/15 under Section 10 of the Guardians and Wards Act pending
in the court of learned District J udge, Dibrugarh is transferred to the
learned District J udge, Sivasagar, who will have power to delegate it
to another appropriate and competent court.

The learned Court of District Judge, Dibrugarh shall transfer
the records of Misc. Case (G) No.1/15 to the learned Court of District
Judge, Sivasagar. In this regard, it would be the duty of the
petitioner to produce a certified copy of this order before the learned
Court of District Judge, Dibrugarh for transfer of the said
proceedings.

The parties, who are represented by their learned counsels are
directed to appear in person or through duly instructed pleader
before the court of the learned District Judge, Dibrguarh on
03.11.2017 and by producing a certified copy of this order, shall

seek further instruction from the said learned court.

Tr.P.(C) No. 77/2016 - Kabita Baid Vs. Dharamchand Baid The petitioner/ wife is the defendant in T.S.(D) No. 17/2016,

pending before the learned Court of District Judge, Bongaigaon,
which is a petition under Section 13(1)(i-a) and (i-b) of Hindu
Marriage Act, 1955, seeking dissolution of marriage by divorce and
other reliefs. The petitioner has prayed for transfer of the said case
from the learned Court of District Judge, Bongaigaon to the learned
Court of Principal J udge, Family Court, Kamrup (M), Guwahati. It Is
stated that the petitioner has shifted her residence from Kokrajhar to
Guwahati for better treatment as she is suffering from “Prolapse
Intervertebral Disc”. She also had to shift her place of residence

from her parental home because her status as a lady living

Page 19 of 32
V.

separately from husband without any children is causing stigma to
the family, which is hindering the marriage of her sister. The
respondent has contested the case by filing Affidavit- in- opposition,
Stating that the petitioner is contesting Misc. Case No. 42/2016,
which is an application under section 125 Cr.P.C. at Bongaigaon. It is
also stated that the respondent is an orthopedically challenged
person who cannot move without an escort and for the said purpose,
the respondent has relied on a concession certificate annexed to his
affidavit- in- opposition. Therefore, considering the un-denied
statement that the petitioner is contesting Misc. Case No. 42/2016,
under section 125 Cr.P.C. at Bongaigaon and that the respondent is
an orthopedically challenged person, and on further considering the
fact that the respondent has sought for transfer only because she
has changed her residence, this Court is of the view that this is not a
fit case for the transfer of the proceedings of T.S.(D) No. 17/2016,
pending before the learned Court of District J udge, Bongaigaon. In
this case, this Court finds that the ratio of the case Bharatiben
Ravibhal Rav (supra) \s found to be applicable as the petitioner is
pursuing Misc. Case No. 46/2016 under Section 125 Cr.P.C. at
Bongaigaon. Hence, this application stands dismissed.

The parties, who are represented by their learned counsels are
directed to appear in person or through duly instructed pleader
before the court of the Court of the learned District Judge,
Bongaigaon on 03.11.2017 and by producing a certified copy of

this order, shall seek further instruction from the said learned court.

7r.P.(C) No. 25/2016 - Sri Sumit Ranjan Nath Vs. Smt.

Suchita Nath - The petitioner- husband is seeking transfer of the
proceedings of TS 93/2013 from the learned Court of District J udge,
Karimganj to the Court of Principal J udge, Family Court, Kamrup (M),
Guwahati. It is projected that TS 96/2013 between the parties was
compromised and disposed of by order dated 09.06.2014 passed by

Page 20 of 32
Vi.

the learned District J udge, Karimganj, by which the parties agreed to
live a conjugal life. But the same did not last. Thereafter, a decree of
divorce was validly passed by the learned Court of Principal J udge,
Family Court, Guwahati by order dated 08.09.2015 in F.C.(Civil) Case
No. 148/15. However, despite the decree, the respondent- wife has
filed Title (Restitution) Suit No. 14/2016 under section 9 of the Hindu
Marriage Act, 1955 before the learned Court of District J udge,
Karimganj, again seeking restitution of conjugal rights. The
petitioner is a personnel of Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB). The
respondent- wife has contested this application by filing Affidavit- inOpposition, claiming that the decree of divorce was obtained by
fraud. On perusal of the petition for divorce, being F.C.(C) 148/2015
as well as the agreement dated 29.06.2015 for divorce, both filed by
the respondent and copy of order dated 08.09.2015 passed in
F.C.(C) Case No. 148/2015 that the respondent has not been paid
any alimony or maintenance. The petitioner being a member of
Sashastra Seema Bal, can undertake the journey to Karimganj, but it
would be extremely difficult for the respondent to travel from
Karimganj to Guwahati. Therefore, this court finds that this is not a
fit case for transfer of the proceeding.

However, considering the submissions made by the learned
counsel for the petitioner that there is a decree of divorce operating,
the petitioner is permitted to move the learned Court of District
Judge, Karimganj with an appropriate application for considering the
maintainability of the Title (Restitution) Suit No. 14/2016. Till the
decision thereon, the petitioner shall also be at liberty to move the
said learned court for exemption from any personal appearance.

With the aforesaid observation, this application stands dismissed.

Tr.P.(C) No. 34/2017 - Smt. Anamika Gogoi Vs. Sr Manoj

Saikia - The petitioner/ wife is the defendant in Mat. Suit
(Restitution) No. 72/2016, pending before the learned Court of

Page 21 of 32
District J udge, Nagaon. The petitioner has prayed for transfer of the
said case from the learned Court of District Judge, Nagaon to the
learned Court of District J udge, Sonitpur, Tezpur. It is stated that the
respondent Is a police personnel and has sufficient clout at Nagaon,
which is an intimidating factor for the petitioner to produce her
witnesses at Nagaon. It is submitted that she has recently joined as
a Teacher in Tezpur Govt. HS School and has taken up a rented
accommodation at Tezpur and her minor daughter is also studying at
Tezpur and she has no one to look after the minor daughter if she is
to go to Nagaon to attend the case. On threat and assault received
by her, she has instituted police case, which is now registered as GR
Case No. 3262/16 - State Vs. Manoj Saikia, and is pending before
the learned Court of Chief J udicial Magistrate, Tezour. No one has
entered appearance for the respondent although notice was served
on his police station. Considering the statement that the respondent
IS a police personnel and the petitioner apprehends threat, and
moreover, aS GR Case No. 3262/16 is stated to be pending before
the learned Court of Chief J udicial Magistrate, Tezpur, this court is of
the view that the ratio of the case Bharatiben Ravibhal Rav (supra) \s
applicable. Therefore, the proceedings of Mat. Suit (Restitution) No.
72/2016, pending before the learned Court of District J udge, Nagaon
stands transferred to the learned Court of District Judge, Sonitpur,
Tezpur. In this regard, it would be the duty of the petitioner to
produce a certified copy of this order before the learned Court of
District J udge, Nagaon for transfer of the said proceedings. As the
respondent herein has not entered appearance, the learned Court of
District Judge, Nagaon, shall fix the date of appearance of the
respondent (i.e. petitioner in T.S.(R) 72/16) before the learned Court
of District J udge, Sonitpur on 03.11.2017.

seek further instruction from the said learned court. The learned
District J udge, Tezpur, would be at liberty to transfer the case before

any other competent Court for trial.

7r.P.(C) No. 26/2017 - Smt. Dipannita_ Guha Das Vs. Sri
Bapan Das - The petitioner/ wife is the defendant in T.S. (M) No.

7/2017. The petitioner has prayed for transfer of the said case from
the learned Court of District Judge, Jorhat to the learned Court of
District J udge, Hojai. It is submitted that the petitioner had filed an
application under section 12 of the Protection of Women from
Domestic Violence Act, 2005, being D.V. Case No. 12/2006, which is
pending before the learned Court of Judicial Magistrate, 1° Class,
Hojai, which is being contested by the respondent. It is submitted

Jurisdiction is one of such categories. The advancement of technology ought to be utilized also for service on
parties or receiving communication from the parties. Every district court
must have at least one e-mail 1D. Administrative instructions for directions
can be issued to permit the litigants to access the court, especially when
litigant Is located outside the local jurisdiction of the Court. Order
incorporating such safeguards may be sent along with the summons. The
safeguards can be:
I) Availability of video conferencing facility. IV) E-mail address/phone number, if any, at which litigant from out

geographical situation of the State, further submitting that there are
three corners of the State and in order to travel from one corner of
the State to the other, it may take anything between 110-12 hours
to 24 hours by bus and by train. e. It was submitted that the court should also take note of female
literacy in the State as well as the educational background of the
wives in each case before permitting trail by video-conferencing. f. It is also submitted that if trial by video- conferencing is allowed, the
ladies would have to bear with double financial burden, one for one
set of counsel for representing them before the trial court, to file
pleadings, petitions, documents, argument, and another set of
counsels at the Town/ City/ Sub-Division, where there are presently
residing to give legal counselling and to guide them through the
entire proceedings, to prepare written statement, evidence- onaffidavits. Page 8 of 32

pleadings or petitions sent by post would reach the Court on time
and the office staff receiving post would promptly open postal
envelopes and tag such pleadings and petitions on record on the
date fixed. 8) Mr. PK Deka, the learned counsel for one of the petitioner has
Submitted that the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Krishna Veni
Nagam (supra) did not disturb the power and jurisdiction of this Court under
Section 24 CPC to transfer a suit from one court to another within its
jurisdiction in the State. He has submitted that the said judgment should be
considered to be prospective because of what was stated in paragraph-18
thereof. However, in his case, the summons stage was over and the trial
was going on. Moreover, the consistent views of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India as well as of the various High Court
including this Court that in respect of matrimonial cases, about the theory of
considering the convenience of wife had not been diluted in the case of

Krishna Veni Nagam (supra). 10) Mr. R. Sharma, the learned counsel appearing for one of the
petitioner has submitted that the husband is a police at the district of
Nagaon and therefore, he carries with him a clout in his hometown and
therefore, out of fear of the police husband, her witnesses may not be
inclined to give evidence at Nagaon and therefore, it is a fit case for transfer
of the proceeding to Tezpur in the district of Sonitpur. It is submitted
that it is a well settled law that procedural law is a handmade of justice. Therefore, the discretion which was hitherto available to the High Court
while deciding the application filed under Section 24 CPC is no longer
available and a question of law will arise whether in light of the direction
contained in the case of Krishna Veni Nagam (supra), whether this Court has
the power or jurisdiction to carve out any exception. He further submits that
all other cases including the case of Bharatiben Ravibhal (supra), cited by
the counsels for various petitioners can be distinguished from the ratio of the
case in Krishna Veni Nagam (supra), because all other cases are judgment in
personam, but judgment in the case of Krishna Veni Nagam (supra),
because of being circulated to all the High Courts, should be treated a
judgment in rem and it should be mandatorily treated as a direction under
Article 141 of the Constitution of India. 15) Having considered the arguments made by all the learned counsels
in all the cases, this Court would like to state that it is not aloof from the
realities of life and that it is insensitive with the various problems the wives
have to face once they were driven out from the matrimonial house and the
inevitable social stigma and financial and mental anxiety suffered by her to
maintain a litigation as well as to minor children, if any, born out of the
wedlock. Harish Nagam from J abalpur, Madhya Pradesh
to Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh. Hence, this Court is of the view
that in cases, where the wife has reservations from trial on videoconferencing, it would be just and proper to transfer the proceedings from

one place to another, instead of compelling a trial by video-conferencing. There are no provisions of sending petitions by e-mail
and for its acceptance by Courts. 18) Moreover, in some cases, where there are pending litigations
between the parties in the place where the wife is residing as was the facts
In the case of Bharatiben Ravibhai (supra), where there was a pending
litigation at Dungarpur (Rajasthan), for which the matrimonial proceedings

the learned Counsels appearing for the respondents herein.

2) These petitions have been filed under Section 24 of the Civil
Procedure Code, by which cases relating to matrimonial disputes and/or
Guardianship dispute pending in various courts are sought to be transferred

from one District to another.

3) The reason for hearing all the matters together was deemed
necessitated in view of the recent judgment delivered by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India in the case of Krishna Veni Nagam vs. Harish Nagam
reported in (2017) 4 SCC 150. This judgment has been circulated to this
Court by the Registry of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. It would be

relevant to refer to paragraphs -13 to 20 thereof, which is extracted below:

“13. We have considered the above suggestions. /n this respect, we may
also refer to the doctrine of forum non conveniens which can be applied in
matrimonial proceedings for advancing interest of justice. Under the said
doctrine, the court exercises its inherent jurisdiction to stay proceedings at
a forum which Is considered not to be convenient and there is any other
forum which Is considered to be more convenient for the interest of all the
parties at the ends of justice. !1n Moai Entertainment Network and anr. Vv.
W.S.G. Cricket Pte. Ltal[(2003) 4 SCC 341] this Court observed:

“19. In Soiliada Maritime case[Soiliada Maritime Coron. V.
Cansulex Ltd, (1986) 3 All ER 843: 1987 AC 460 : (1986) 3 WLR
972(HL)] the House of Lords laid down the following jrinaple:

‘The fundamental princiole applicable to both the stay of
English proceedings on the ground that some other forum was the
appropriate forum and also the grant of leave to serve proceedings
out of the jurisdiction was that the court would choose that forum
in Which the case could be tried more suitably for the interest of all
the parties and for the ends of justice......”

The criteria to determine which was a more approorniate forum, for
the purpose of ordering stay of the suit, the court would look for
that forum with which the action had the most real and substantial
connection in terms of convenience or expense, availability of
witnesses, the law governing the relevant transaction and the
places where the parties resided or carried on business. If the court

Page 3 of 32
concluded that there was no other available forum which was more
appropriate than the English court, it would normally refuse a stay.
/f, however, the court concluded that there was another forum
Which was prima facie more appropriate, the court would normally
grant a stay unless there were arcumstances militating against a
Stay. /t was noted that as the alsoute concerning the contract in
Which the proper law was English law, it meant that England was
the appropriate forum in which the case could be more suitably
tried.”

Though these observations have been made in the context of
granting anti suit injunction, the principle can be followed in regulating the
exerase of jurisdiction of the court where proceedings are instituted. /n a
avil proceeding, the plaintiff is the dominus /itis but if more than one court
has jurisdiction, court can determine which Is the convenient forum and lay
down conaitions in the interest of justice subject to which its jurisdiction
may be availed. [Kusum Ingots & Alloys Lta. v. Union of India, (2004) 6 SCC
254, pata-30].

14, One cannot ignore the problem faced by a husband if proceedings are
transferred on account of genuine difficulties faced by the wife. The
husband may find it difficult to contest proceedings at a place which Is
convenient to the wife. Thus, transfer is not always a solution acceotable to
both the parties. !t may be appropriate that available technology of video
conferencing Is used where both the parties have egual difficulty and there
Is no place which is convenient to both the parties. We understand that in
every district in the country video conferencing Is now available. !n any
case, Wherever such facility is available, it ought to be fully utilized and all
the High Courts ought to issue appropriate administrative instructions to
regulate the use of video conferencing for certain category of cases.
Matrimonial cases where one of the parties resides outside court's
Jurisdiction is one of such categories. Wherever one or both the parties
make a request for use of video conference, proceedings may be conducted
on video conferencing, obviating the needs of the party to appear in person.
/n several cases, this Court has directed recording of evidence by video
conferencing. [State of Maharashtra v. Praful B. Desai, (2003) 4 SCC 601:
2003 SCC (Cri) 815; Kalyan Chandra Sarkar v. Rajesh Ranjan, (2005) 3 SCC
284; 2005 SCC (Cri) 705; Budhadev Karmaskar (4) v. State of W.B., (2011)
10 SCC 283 : (2012) 1 SCC (Cr) 285; Malthesh Gudda Pooja v. State of
Karnataka, (2011) 15 SCC 330: (2014) 2 SCC (Civ) 473].

15. The other difficulty faced by the parties living beyond the local
Jurisdiction of the court Is ignorance about availability of suitable legal
services. Legal Aid Committee of every district ought to make available
selected panel of advocates whose discipline and quality can be suitably
regulated and who are ready to provide legal aid at a specitied fee. Such
panels ought to be notified on the websites of the District Legal Services
Authorities/State Legal Services Authorities/National Legal Services
Authority. This may enhance access to justice consistent with Article 39A of
the Constitution.

16. The advancement of technology ought to be utilized also for service on
parties or receiving communication from the parties. Every district court
must have at least one e-mail 1D. Administrative instructions for directions
can be issued to permit the litigants to access the court, especially when
litigant Is located outside the local jurisdiction of the Court. A designated
officer/manager of a district court may suitably respond to such e-mail in

Page 4 of 32
the manner permitted as per the administrative instructions. Similarly, a
manager/ information officer in every alstrict court may be accessible on a
notified teleohone during notified hours as per the instructions. These steos
may, to some extent, take care of the problems of the litigants. These
suggestions may need attention of the High Courts.

17. We are thus of the view that it is necessary to issue certain directions
Which may provide alternative to seeking transfer of proceedings on
account of inability of a party to contest proceedings at a place away from
their ordinary residence on the ground that if proceedings are not
transferred it will result in denial of justice.

18 We, therefore direct that in matrimonial or custody matters or in
proceedings between parties to a marriage or arising out of adlsoutes
between parties to a marriage, wherever the defendants/ respondents are
located outside the jurisdiction of the court, the court where proceedings
are instituted may examine whether it Is in the interest of justice to
Incorporate any safeguards for ensuring that summoning” of
defendant/resoondent does not result in denial of Justice. Order
incorporating such safeguards may be sent along with the summons. The
safeguards can be:
I) Availability of video conferencing facility.

Il) Availability of legal aid service.

iii) Deoosit of cost for travel, lodging and boarding in terms of Order
XXV CPC.

IV) E-mail address/phone number, if any, at which litigant from out

station may communicate.

19. We hope the above arrangement may, to an extent, reduce hardship to
the litigants as noted above in the Order of this Court dated 9th /anuary,
2017. However, in the present case since the matter is pending in this Court
for about three years, we are satisfied that the prayer for transfer may be
allowed. Accordingly, we direct that proceedings in Case No.179A4/2013
under Section 13 of the Act titled “Harish Nagam vs. Krishna Veni Nagam”
pending on the file of 11 Presiding Judge, Family Court, /abalour, Madhya
Pradesh shall stand transferred to the Family Court, Hyderabad, Andhra
Pradesh. /f the parties seek meatation the transferee court may explore the
possibility of an amicable settlement through mediation. 1t will be open to
the transferee court to conduct the proceedings or record evidence of the
witnesses who are unable to appear in court by way of video conferencing.
Records shall be sent by court where proceedings are pending to the
transferee court forthwith.

20. The Registry to transmit a copy of this order to the courts concerned. A
copy of this order be sent to all the High Courts for aooropriate action.”

Page 5 of 32
4) On enquiry, this Court has been informed that save and except four
districts of Assam, viz., N.C. Hills Autonomous District, Karbi Anglong
Autonomous District, Baska District and Chirang District, all other District
Courts have already set up with Video Conference facilities. Under the
aforesaid background, this Court deems fit that analogous hearing of this
cases be taken up so that there can be a threadbare discussion on the
matter. The various counsels for the petitioner’s side had voiced their
grievance regarding the adoptability of the Video Conference facilities for the
common public in the State of Assam, for which, the learned counsels for all
the petitioners had argued in favour of transfer of the matrimonial
proceedings instead of compelling the petitioners to accept the Video

Conference facility for trial of cases.

5) The following causes for their concern have been cited by the
learned counsels for the petitioners 
a. It is submitted that by and large in all cases, the wives who are in
distress and who were either driven out from the matrimonial home
or compelled to leave their matrimonial homes for variety of reasons,
are the petitioners herein. The petitioners have prayed for transfer of
the proceedings to the place where they are presently residing.

b. In majority of cases, the distressed wife, has no earning capacity.
They claim to be either dependent to their parents or their brothers
for their living. In many cases, the wives are also burdened to take
care of their minor children, their education and healthy growth, etc.
It is claimed that in many cases, the issue of maintenance have not
been settled, and even if any maintenance is allowed from their
estranged husband, the money awarded is a mere pittance, which is
not sufficient to take decent care of themselves, not to speak of
minor children.

c. It is submitted that being females, they have to face a great
difficulty to travel from their parental home to attend the Court in a

distant place away from their residence.

Page 6 of 32
d. The counsels have also asked this court to take notice of the
geographical situation of the State, further submitting that there are
three corners of the State and in order to travel from one corner of
the State to the other, it may take anything between 110-12 hours
to 24 hours by bus and by train. It is also submitted that few
Districts of the State stay inundated by flood water for 1-2 months in
a year for which normal life is disrupted for a total of 3-4 months
due to the annual calamity of flood. During these times, females not
only feel insecure for travelling alone in nigh-super and in trains, but
during these times of distress, as the male members of their parental
family are already having difficult times, they cannot spare time to
escort the females to court at a distant place.

e. It was submitted that the court should also take note of female
literacy in the State as well as the educational background of the
wives in each case before permitting trail by video-conferencing. It is
submitted that the uneducated and not too much technology savvy
ladies would find it difficult to conduct a trial under Video
Conferencing unless they are assisted by the equally tech-savvy
counsel. The ladies, who are left to be deprived without any legal
Support would find it very difficult to conduct a trial in Video
Conferencing.

f. It is also submitted that if trial by video- conferencing is allowed, the
ladies would have to bear with double financial burden, one for one
set of counsel for representing them before the trial court, to file
pleadings, petitions, documents, argument, and another set of
counsels at the Town/ City/ Sub-Division, where there are presently
residing to give legal counselling and to guide them through the
entire proceedings, to prepare written statement, evidence- onaffidavits. She would have to keep constant touch with both sets of
the counsel to keep herself updated about the dates posted in the

case and to monitor the date-wise progress of the case.

Page 7 of 32
g. It is submitted that even if trial is conducted by video-conferencing,
there is no denial that the lady would still be compelled to travel
from time to time to the town where the trial is taking place for the
purpose of paying fees of the counsel as well as for filing various
petitions requiring swearing of affidavit in support of the petitions,
unless this court completely waives the requirement of filing
petitions with original signature.

h. It is urged that a lady, who is financially starved and facing social
stigma connected with a lady whose husband has left her, and lack
of support from her own parental family, such a lady would be lucky
if she can engaged advocates at both her nearest court as well as
the town where litigation is filed. 1t would be still difficult to organize
two sets of unknown counsel to work in the tandem with each other
with the required coordination, because if the two sets of lawyers do
not coordinate with each other then, there are no chances of getting
a fair trial. There is a remote chance that a lady may get the service
of a counsel, who Is willing to take assignment only a date wise basis
without any continuity of engagement, because it is a common
practice that counsel is engaged for the entire life of litigation, and
no good counsel with some reputation would consent to take steps
only on as and when occasion arises. Therefore, if videoconferencing is allowed, there would be additional financial burden
on the wife to engage counsel at two different places, keep travelling
to and fro.

I. It is submitted that every lady is not staying in Towns/ City/ SubDivisional Towns, some of them would have to travel some distance
from their villages to reach the nearest Court having Videoconferencing facilities.

j. It is further argued that it would be a risky affair for a lady to send
the original documents by post to the town where litigation is going

on as it may get lost during transit.

Page 8 of 32
k. It is submitted that it would be equally risky for a lady to believe that
pleadings or petitions sent by post would reach the Court on time
and the office staff receiving post would promptly open postal
envelopes and tag such pleadings and petitions on record on the
date fixed. Therefore, unless the lady can successfully interact with
Presiding Officer of Court at around 10.30 am, she would not know
what would happen to her case in course of the day. Without
permitting interaction at a fixed time, no court would adjourn a case
merely because of postal delay.

|. The ground reality of lack of uninterrupted electricity supply, lack of
uninterrupted internet connectivity must also be addressed, as to
what would happen if on a particular day, due to mobile link failure,
electricity failure and internet link failure a remote station litigant
cannot get connected even over mobile phone to inform Court
Managers about internet/ mobile link failure. Examples were cited of
link failure in banks which stops all transactions including ATM
transactions, connectivity problems faced while e-filing of Income
Tax returns and GST returns in recent times, which became news

headlines.

6) It is also submitted that the judgment in Krishna Veni Nagam (supra)
was by a Division Bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, which had not overruled various orders by co-ordinate Bench of equal strength, whereby the
Hon’ble Supreme Court had deemed it fit to transfer matrimonial cases in the
place of choice of the wife. It is submitted that if permitted, they are ready
to refer to many cases where such cases were transferred. Hence, they
Submit that the case of Krishna Veni Nagarnisupora) should be treated as a
judgment per-incurium, which had not taken note of the previous orders by
co-ordinate Benches of equal strength, allowing transfer of matrimonial

CaSes.

Page 9 of 32
7) All the counsels for the petitioners’ side are unison in submitting that
trial by video- conferencing may be possible for some of the parties, but by
and large, unless such trial is started at an experimental basis in one or two
given case where parties are consenting, the permitting all trial by videoconferencing may not be the ideal solution for the State of Assam, which is
technologically not so advanced like metropolitan cities like Mumbai and New
Delhi.

8) Mr. PK Deka, the learned counsel for one of the petitioner has
Submitted that the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Krishna Veni
Nagam (supra) did not disturb the power and jurisdiction of this Court under
Section 24 CPC to transfer a suit from one court to another within its
jurisdiction in the State. He has submitted that the said judgment should be
considered to be prospective because of what was stated in paragraph-18
thereof. It is submitted that in this particular paragraph -18, the Hon’ble
Supreme Court was referring to incorporate safeguard for ensuring that
Summoning of defendants /respondents does not result in denial of justice
and therefore, ordered for safeguards to be mentioned while issuing of
Summonses. However, in his case, the summons stage was over and the trial
was going on. By citing various cases, where various High Courts in the
Country as well as the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India had transferred
matrimonial proceedings to the city/town where the wife was residing. He
specifically relies on the following four cases:

a. Rabinatra Kaur v. /itendra Singh, AlR 2000 SC 3403.

b. Sumita Singh Vs. Kumar Sanjay, AlR 2002 SC 396.

Cc. Durga Panalit Vs. Pradio Kumar Pandit, (2004) 1 GLT 440.

a. Pallavi Saikia Vs. Mriganka Bharall, (2006) SUPP GLT 425.

9) Mr. B. Chakraborty, the learned counsel appearing for one of the
petitioner has submitted that the case of Krishna Veni Nagam (suora) may
not be made applicable in these cases, firstly, because the Hon’ble Supreme

Court was passing an order under Section 25 CPC and it was not deciding

Page 10 of 32
the matter under Section 24 CPC. Moreover, the consistent views of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India as well as of the various High Court
including this Court that in respect of matrimonial cases, about the theory of
considering the convenience of wife had not been diluted in the case of

Krishna Veni Nagam (supra).

10) Mr. R. Sharma, the learned counsel appearing for one of the
petitioner has submitted that the husband is a police at the district of
Nagaon and therefore, he carries with him a clout in his hometown and
therefore, out of fear of the police husband, her witnesses may not be
inclined to give evidence at Nagaon and therefore, it is a fit case for transfer
of the proceeding to Tezpur in the district of Sonitpur. He also relies on the
case of Bharatiben Ravibhal Rav Vs. Ravibhal Govindbhal Rav decided on
05.05.2017 and reported in (2017) 6 SCC 785 to project that in the said
case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court did not deem it fit to permit Video
Conference and transfer the case from one district to another for the
convenience of wife and also considering the fact that when another
proceeding is pending between the parties in the courts where the wife is
residing and in this connection, he has submitted that at present three

separate proceedings initiated by the wife is currently pending at Tezpur.

11) Per contra, arguing in support of the idea of trial by video
conferencing, it is submitted that it is equally true for the husband to travel
to the place of choice of the wife and to face trial at a distant place. It is
Submitted that the husband are engaged in some service, profession,
business or other vocation to earn his livelihood. While it would not be
inconvenient for the wife to travel, if she is unemployed, but it would be very
difficult for the husband to avail leave to travel to attend matrimonial cases,
which is likely to affect the service carrier, business, profession or vocation.
It is submitted that in appropriate cases, if the problem faced by the wife is

genuine, the courts may, on case to case basis, order a reasonable cost of

Page 11 of 32
litigation, travel, lodging and food for the wife, children (if any), and an

escort.

12) Mr. Sishir Dutta, the learned senior counsel for one of the
respondent has referred to the case of MN. Murthy v. State of Karnataka,
(2003) 7 SCC 514 to argue that unless the order specifically provides for
prospective overruling, all judgments are deemed to have retrospective
effect and, as such, the argument by the learned counsel for the petitioners
that the case of Krishna Veni Nagam (supra) Nas prospective application is
not sustainable in view of the ratio laid down in the case of MN Murthy

(supra).

13) Mr. Saurav Kataki, the learned counsel for one of the respondent has
Submitted that Section 24 CPC is a procedural law and therefore, in a strict
sense, Section 24 is not a statutory law but a procedural law. It is submitted
that it is a well settled law that procedural law is a handmade of justice.
However, when the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India has given a direction as
to what procedure should be adopted in case of transfer of matrimonial suit,
In that case, the said decision becomes a law binding on all Courts and
Tribunals under the provisions of Article 141 of the Constitution of India.
Therefore, the discretion which was hitherto available to the High Court
while deciding the application filed under Section 24 CPC is no longer
available and a question of law will arise whether in light of the direction
contained in the case of Krishna Veni Nagam (supra), whether this Court has
the power or jurisdiction to carve out any exception. He further submits that
all other cases including the case of Bharatiben Ravibhal (supra), cited by
the counsels for various petitioners can be distinguished from the ratio of the
case in Krishna Veni Nagam (supra), because all other cases are judgment in
personam, but judgment in the case of Krishna Veni Nagam (supra),
because of being circulated to all the High Courts, should be treated a
judgment in rem and it should be mandatorily treated as a direction under
Article 141 of the Constitution of India.

Page 12 of 32
14) All the learned counsels for the parties have argued their respective
arguments but their submissions are consonance with the submission
already recorded above, it is not deemed necessary to reiterate those

arguments to burden this order.

15) Having considered the arguments made by all the learned counsels
in all the cases, this Court would like to state that it is not aloof from the
realities of life and that it is insensitive with the various problems the wives
have to face once they were driven out from the matrimonial house and the
inevitable social stigma and financial and mental anxiety suffered by her to
maintain a litigation as well as to minor children, if any, born out of the
wedlock. However, the majority of objections raised by the learned counsels
for the petitioners appeared to be answered by the Hon’ble Supreme Court
of India in pargarphs-14 to 18 of the case of Krishna Veni Nagam (supra),

which are already extracted above.

16) However, it must be noted that even in the case of Krishna Veni
Nagam (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India deemed it fit to transfer
the case of the husband, |.e. Harish Nagam from J abalpur, Madhya Pradesh
to Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh. Therefore, the question arises, that when
the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the said case of Krishna Veni Nagam
(supra), did not deem it fit not to transfer the matrimonial proceedings by
ordering trial by video-conferencing, and when the Hon'ble Supreme Court of
India in the subsequent case of Bharatiben Ravibhal Rav (supra), where the
matrimonial proceedings was transferred from Ahmedabad (Gujrat) to
Dungarpur (Rajasthan), there is no doubt that the Hon’ble Supreme Court of
India deemed it fit to exclude some cases from video-conferencing, where
the parties did not consent for such trial. Hence, this Court is of the view
that in cases, where the wife has reservations from trial on videoconferencing, it would be just and proper to transfer the proceedings from

one place to another, instead of compelling a trial by video-conferencing.

Page 13 of 32
17) This court has also taken note of the practical problems and
difficulties expressed by the learned counsels for the petitioners. To mention
a few, there is no provision under the Gauhati High Court Rules as well as
Civil Court Rules & Orders of the Gauhati High Court relating to trial by
video-conferencing. There are no provisions of sending petitions by e-mail
and for its acceptance by Courts. There is no provision to empower a trial
court to defer the proceedings merely because it receives communication
over phone call to Court Manager of by e-mail that pleadings or petitions had
been despatched by post. The subordinate Court staffs have not been
sensitized to promptly open postal envelopes and urgently tag the petitions
received by post in court record and to place them before the Court. The
Presiding Officers of the Courts are not yet sensitized to wait till such time in
the day till postal service is usually made to court premises, for which there
is every possibility that a court may pass orders in first half of the day and
the postal delivery containing petitions and pleadings being received after
orders are passed. There is no provisions in Gauhati High Court Rules as well
as Civil Court Rules & Orders of the Gauhati High Court about what would
happen if a party agreeing for trial by video-conference sends a pleading,
petition or document by post and the postal envelope is misplaced and what
would be the procedure for reconstruction of documents not received by
court, but lost in postal transit. There are no provisions in the Gauhati High
Court Rules as well as Civil Court Rules & Orders of the Gauhati High Court
to make a Court Manager as an agent for the out-station litigant, so as to
enable the Courts to accept submissions made by a Court Manager on the
basis of telephonic message or e-mail received from a litigant, and to pass
orders on the basis of any submissions made before the Court. The
procedure of regular trial by Video-conferencing, in the opinion of this court,
must be incorporated in the appropriate Rules governing trial like Gauhati
High Court Rules as well as Civil Court Rules & Orders of the Gauhati High
Court, because it is one thing to have an occasional session by Video
Conferencing like delivering judgment, one or two session of cross
Page 14 of 32
examination of accused who for various reasons like internal security, or to
maintain peace and tranquillity, is not desired to be moved from prison, or
video-conferencing with a hospitalized person, periodical viewing of undertrial accused lodged in jail by concerned Magistrates, etc., to name a few.
Therefore, it is hoped that in future, some of the issues are addressed by
this Court so that appropriate Rules are framed for facilitating video
conferencing, aS suggested by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India.

18) Moreover, in some cases, where there are pending litigations
between the parties in the place where the wife is residing as was the facts
In the case of Bharatiben Ravibhai (supra), where there was a pending
litigation at Dungarpur (Rajasthan), for which the matrimonial proceedings
was transferred or in one of the present case in hand, where the husband Is
a police personnel and the wife apprehends threat. This Court cannot shut

its eyes to such practical ground realities.

19) Moreover, it has come to the notice of this Court that the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India in the case of Santhini Vs. Vijaya Venketesh by an
order dated 09.08.2017 (Para-19), has referred the case of Krishna Veni
Nagam (supra) to the Hon’ble The Chief J ustice of India to consider referring
the said case before a larger Bench. The outcome of such reference is not

known. The relevant para of the said order is quoted below:
‘19. To what extent the confidence and confidentiality will be
safeguarded and protected in video conferencing, particularly when
efforts are taken by the counsellors, welfare experts, and for that
matter, the court itself for reconciliation, restitution of conjugal rights
or alssolution of marriage, ascertainment of the wishes of the child in
custody matters, etc, Is a serious issue to be considered. /t Is
certainly difficult in video conferencing, if not impossible, to maintain
confidentiality. It has also to be noted that the footage in video
conterenang becomes part of the record whereas the reconciiatory
efforts taken by the duty-holders referred to above are not meant to
be part of the record. All that aoart, in reconciiatory efforts, physical
presence of the parties would make a significant difference. Having
regard to the very object behind the establishment of Family Courts
Act, 1984, to Order XXXIIA of the Code of Civil Procedure and to the

Page 15 of 32
soedal provisions introduced in the Hindu Marriage Act under
Sections 22, 23 and 26, we are of the view that the airections Issued
by this Court in Krishna Veni Nagam (supra) need reconsideration on
the aspect of video conferencing in matrimonial disputes. ”

20) Therefore, in the overall view of the matter, as the case of Krishna
Veni Nagam (supra) does not lay down a law prohibiting transfer of any case
and instead follow the course of trial by video-conferencing, this court is of
the view that until some provisions are made in the Gauhati High Court Rules
as well as Civil Court Rules & Orders of the Gauhati High Court in respect of
full trial by video-conferencing, it would not be in the interest of the litigants
of the State of Assam to mandatorily undertake a full length trial by videoconferencing as an alternative of transfer of suits. The provisions of Section
24 CPC having not been struck-off, the power of this Court to exercise
jurisdiction under Section 24 CPC to transfer suits and proceedings cannot be
taken away in appropriate cases. In light of the various orders passed by the
Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in the various cases referred herein before,
with greatest respect to the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India, as the case of
Krishna Vent Nagam (supra) is under reconsideration of the said Hon'ble
Court and as even in the said judgment, the matrimonial case was indeed
transferred from Jabalpur to Hyderabad, in the absence of law laid down
curtailing the power of this Court to exercise jurisdiction under Section 24
CPC, this court is inclined to continue to exercise jurisdiction under Section
24 CPC.

21) With the aforesaid observations, the individual cases are now taken

up:
. IPPC) No. 14/2017 - Smt. Subarna Bhattacharjee Vs. Sri

Siddartha Biswas - \n this case, the petitioner- wife is seeking
transfer of proceedings of F.C.(C) Case No. 77/2017 from the Court
of Principal J udge, Family Court, Kamrup (M), Guwahati to the Court
of Principal Judge, Family Court, Silchar. She is a Doctor and
associated with works of National Rural Health Mission. She has a

Page 16 of 32
minor baby. Petitioner has no brother, but lives with aged parents.
She claims that marriage was solemnized at Silchar and after
marriage, she was living in their matrimonial home and Kolkata and
the case was filed at Guwahati to harass her and the Court at
Guwahati had no jurisdiction. In the affidavit in opposition, the
respondent has not denied that after marriage at Silchar, their
matrimonial home was not at Kolkata. Therefore, this court deems it
fit to transfer the proceedings of F.C.(C) Case No. 77/2017 from the
Court of Principal J udge, Family Court, Kamrup (M), Guwahati to the
Court of Principal J udge, Family Court, Silchar. The learned Court of
Principal J udge, Family Court, Kamrup (M), Guwahati shall transfer
the records of F.C.(C) Case No. 77/2017 to the Court of Principal
Judge, Family Court, Silchar. In this regard, it would be the duty of
the petitioner to produce a certified copy of this order before the
Court of Principal Judge, Family Court, Kamrup (M), Guwahati for
transfer of the said proceedings.

The parties, who are represented by their counsel, shall appear
before the Court of Principal J udge, Family Court, Cachar, Silchar, on
03.11.2017 without any further notice for appearance and by
producing certified copy of this order, shall seek further instruction

from the said learned Court.

7r.P.(C) No. 11/2017 - Maya Das (Thapa) Vs. Dipankar Das 
In this case, the petitioner/wife is the defendant in FC (Civil) Case
No.309/16 pending before the learned Principal J udge, Family Court,
Silchar, Cachar, which is a petition under Section 9 of the Hindu
Marriage Act, 1955. The petitioner has prayed for transfer of the
case from the Court of learned Principal J udge, Family Court, Cachar,
Silchar to the court of learned Principal Judge, Family Court at
Dimapur, Nagaland. In this case, this Court finds that this is a case
for the transfer from one State to another. In this regard, this Court

in the case of Porm Sengupta vs. Biswaj/it Senguota, (2015) 6 GLR

Page 17 of 32
396; (2016) 1 GLT 627, had discussed the jurisdiction of the Court
under Section 24 CPC and had laid down that this Court does not
have jurisdiction to make inter-State transfer of the suites and
proceedings. Therefore, such transfer, in the considered opinion of
this Court can only be made under Section 25 CPC. Therefore, by
following the precedent of the case of Porn’ Sengupta (supra), this
Court is not inclined to transfer the suit to outside the State although
Subordinate courts in the State of Nagaland are within the
jurisdiction of this Court, but still, it lies outside the State of Assam.
The parties, who are represented by their counsel, shall appear
before the Court of Principal J udge, Family Court, Cachar, Silchar, on
03.11.2017 without any further notice for appearance and by
producing certified copy of this order, shall seek further instruction

from the said learned Court.

Misc. Case (G) No.1/15 pending before the court of learned District
Judge, Dibrugarh, which is a petition under Section 10 of the
Guardians and Wards Act, 1890. The petitioner has prayed for
transfer of the case from the court of learned District Judge,
Dibrugarh to the court of learned District Judge, Sivasagar. The
respondent/husband herein is reported to be a police personnel
serving aS a constable and the minor child (aged 4 years and 5
months, aS no 16.02.2015, the date of filing of the guardianship
petition) is now residing with the petitioner/wife. Moreover, the
petitioner has claimed that she has become entitled to receive
maintenance from the husband as per the order passed by the
learned Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Nazira in Misc. Case
No.2/2014 filed under Section 125 Cr.P.C. (at one place also
mentioned as order passed by the learned Munsiff-cuny] udicial

Magistrate, First Class, Nazira). It appears that the respondent had

Page 18 of 32
also instituted Criminal Revision No.8(1)/2015 before the learned
Sessions J udge, Sivasagar. Therefore, in this case, this Court finds
that the ratio of the case Bharatiben Ravibhai Rav (supra) is found to
be applicable. Therefore, the proceedings of the Misc. Case (G)
No.1/15 under Section 10 of the Guardians and Wards Act pending
in the court of learned District J udge, Dibrugarh is transferred to the
learned District J udge, Sivasagar, who will have power to delegate it
to another appropriate and competent court.

The learned Court of District Judge, Dibrugarh shall transfer
the records of Misc. Case (G) No.1/15 to the learned Court of District
Judge, Sivasagar. In this regard, it would be the duty of the
petitioner to produce a certified copy of this order before the learned
Court of District Judge, Dibrugarh for transfer of the said
proceedings.

The parties, who are represented by their learned counsels are
directed to appear in person or through duly instructed pleader
before the court of the learned District Judge, Dibrguarh on
03.11.2017 and by producing a certified copy of this order, shall

Tr.P.(C) No. 77/2016 - Kabita Baid Vs. Dharamchand Baid The petitioner/ wife is the defendant in T.S.(D) No. 17/2016,

pending before the learned Court of District Judge, Bongaigaon,
which is a petition under Section 13(1)(i-a) and (i-b) of Hindu
Marriage Act, 1955, seeking dissolution of marriage by divorce and
other reliefs. The petitioner has prayed for transfer of the said case
from the learned Court of District Judge, Bongaigaon to the learned
Court of Principal J udge, Family Court, Kamrup (M), Guwahati. It Is
stated that the petitioner has shifted her residence from Kokrajhar to
Guwahati for better treatment as she is suffering from “Prolapse
Intervertebral Disc”. She also had to shift her place of residence

from her parental home because her status as a lady living

Page 19 of 32
V.

separately from husband without any children is causing stigma to
the family, which is hindering the marriage of her sister. The
respondent has contested the case by filing Affidavit- in- opposition,
Stating that the petitioner is contesting Misc. Case No. 42/2016,
which is an application under section 125 Cr.P.C. at Bongaigaon. It is
also stated that the respondent is an orthopedically challenged
person who cannot move without an escort and for the said purpose,
the respondent has relied on a concession certificate annexed to his
affidavit- in- opposition. Therefore, considering the un-denied
statement that the petitioner is contesting Misc. Case No. 42/2016,
under section 125 Cr.P.C. at Bongaigaon and that the respondent is
an orthopedically challenged person, and on further considering the
fact that the respondent has sought for transfer only because she
has changed her residence, this Court is of the view that this is not a
fit case for the transfer of the proceedings of T.S.(D) No. 17/2016,
pending before the learned Court of District J udge, Bongaigaon. In
this case, this Court finds that the ratio of the case Bharatiben
Ravibhal Rav (supra) \s found to be applicable as the petitioner is
pursuing Misc. Case No. 46/2016 under Section 125 Cr.P.C. at
Bongaigaon. Hence, this application stands dismissed.

The parties, who are represented by their learned counsels are
directed to appear in person or through duly instructed pleader
before the court of the Court of the learned District Judge,
Bongaigaon on 03.11.2017 and by producing a certified copy of

this order, shall seek further instruction from the said learned court.

7r.P.(C) No. 25/2016 - Sri Sumit Ranjan Nath Vs. Smt.

Suchita Nath - The petitioner- husband is seeking transfer of the
proceedings of TS 93/2013 from the learned Court of District J udge,
Karimganj to the Court of Principal J udge, Family Court, Kamrup (M),
Guwahati. It is projected that TS 96/2013 between the parties was
compromised and disposed of by order dated 09.06.2014 passed by

Page 20 of 32
Vi.

the learned District J udge, Karimganj, by which the parties agreed to
live a conjugal life. But the same did not last. Thereafter, a decree of
divorce was validly passed by the learned Court of Principal J udge,
Family Court, Guwahati by order dated 08.09.2015 in F.C.(Civil) Case
No. 148/15. However, despite the decree, the respondent- wife has
filed Title (Restitution) Suit No. 14/2016 under section 9 of the Hindu
Marriage Act, 1955 before the learned Court of District J udge,
Karimganj, again seeking restitution of conjugal rights. The
petitioner is a personnel of Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB). The
respondent- wife has contested this application by filing Affidavit- inOpposition, claiming that the decree of divorce was obtained by
fraud. On perusal of the petition for divorce, being F.C.(C) 148/2015
as well as the agreement dated 29.06.2015 for divorce, both filed by
the respondent and copy of order dated 08.09.2015 passed in
F.C.(C) Case No. 148/2015 that the respondent has not been paid
any alimony or maintenance. The petitioner being a member of
Sashastra Seema Bal, can undertake the journey to Karimganj, but it
would be extremely difficult for the respondent to travel from
Karimganj to Guwahati. Therefore, this court finds that this is not a
fit case for transfer of the proceeding.

However, considering the submissions made by the learned
counsel for the petitioner that there is a decree of divorce operating,
the petitioner is permitted to move the learned Court of District
Judge, Karimganj with an appropriate application for considering the
maintainability of the Title (Restitution) Suit No. 14/2016. Till the
decision thereon, the petitioner shall also be at liberty to move the
said learned court for exemption from any personal appearance.

With the aforesaid observation, this application stands dismissed.

Case No. 3262/16 - State Vs. Manoj Saikia, and is pending before
the learned Court of Chief J udicial Magistrate, Tezour. No one has

IS a police personnel and the petitioner apprehends threat, and
moreover, aS GR Case No. 3262/16 is stated to be pending before
the learned Court of Chief J udicial Magistrate, Tezpur, this court is of

72/2016, pending before the learned Court of District J udge, Nagaon
stands transferred to the learned Court of District Judge, Sonitpur,

For the petitioner(s): Mr. P.K. Deka, Mr. K.K. Dey, Mr. C. Baruah, Mr. M.R.
Adhikary, Mr. M. Dutta, Mr. R. Sarma, Mr. B. Sinha, Mr.
R.C. Paul, Mr. S. Alim, Mr. P.P. Borthakur, Mr. K.R.
Patgiri, Mr. H. Sarma, Ms. N. Upadhyay, and Mr. S.
Islam, Advocates. We understand that in
every district in the country video conferencing Is now available. ! Matrimonial cases where one of the parties resides outside court's
Jurisdiction is one of such categories. The advancement of technology ought to be utilized also for service on
parties or receiving communication from the parties. Every district court
must have at least one e-mail 1D. Administrative instructions for directions
can be issued to permit the litigants to access the court, especially when
litigant Is located outside the local jurisdiction of the Court. Order
incorporating such safeguards may be sent along with the summons. The
safeguards can be:
I) Availability of video conferencing facility. IV) E-mail address/phone number, if any, at which litigant from out

station may communicate. Records shall be sent by court where proceedings are pending to the
transferee court forthwith. The Registry to transmit a copy of this order to the courts concerned. They claim to be either dependent to their parents or their brothers
for their living. Page 6 of 32
d. The counsels have also asked this court to take notice of the
geographical situation of the State, further submitting that there are
three corners of the State and in order to travel from one corner of
the State to the other, it may take anything between 110-12 hours
to 24 hours by bus and by train. e. It was submitted that the court should also take note of female
literacy in the State as well as the educational background of the
wives in each case before permitting trail by video-conferencing. f. It is also submitted that if trial by video- conferencing is allowed, the
ladies would have to bear with double financial burden, one for one
set of counsel for representing them before the trial court, to file
pleadings, petitions, documents, argument, and another set of
counsels at the Town/ City/ Sub-Division, where there are presently
residing to give legal counselling and to guide them through the
entire proceedings, to prepare written statement, evidence- onaffidavits. Page 8 of 32
k. It is submitted that it would be equally risky for a lady to believe that
pleadings or petitions sent by post would reach the Court on time
and the office staff receiving post would promptly open postal
envelopes and tag such pleadings and petitions on record on the
date fixed. 8) Mr. PK Deka, the learned counsel for one of the petitioner has
Submitted that the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Krishna Veni
Nagam (supra) did not disturb the power and jurisdiction of this Court under
Section 24 CPC to transfer a suit from one court to another within its
jurisdiction in the State. He has submitted that the said judgment should be
considered to be prospective because of what was stated in paragraph-18
thereof. However, in his case, the summons stage was over and the trial
was going on. Moreover, the consistent views of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India as well as of the various High Court
including this Court that in respect of matrimonial cases, about the theory of
considering the convenience of wife had not been diluted in the case of

Krishna Veni Nagam (supra). 10) Mr. R. Sharma, the learned counsel appearing for one of the
petitioner has submitted that the husband is a police at the district of
Nagaon and therefore, he carries with him a clout in his hometown and
therefore, out of fear of the police husband, her witnesses may not be
inclined to give evidence at Nagaon and therefore, it is a fit case for transfer
of the proceeding to Tezpur in the district of Sonitpur. It is submitted
that it is a well settled law that procedural law is a handmade of justice. Therefore, the discretion which was hitherto available to the High Court
while deciding the application filed under Section 24 CPC is no longer
available and a question of law will arise whether in light of the direction
contained in the case of Krishna Veni Nagam (supra), whether this Court has
the power or jurisdiction to carve out any exception. He further submits that
all other cases including the case of Bharatiben Ravibhal (supra), cited by
the counsels for various petitioners can be distinguished from the ratio of the
case in Krishna Veni Nagam (supra), because all other cases are judgment in
personam, but judgment in the case of Krishna Veni Nagam (supra),
because of being circulated to all the High Courts, should be treated a
judgment in rem and it should be mandatorily treated as a direction under
Article 141 of the Constitution of India. 15) Having considered the arguments made by all the learned counsels
in all the cases, this Court would like to state that it is not aloof from the
realities of life and that it is insensitive with the various problems the wives
have to face once they were driven out from the matrimonial house and the
inevitable social stigma and financial and mental anxiety suffered by her to
maintain a litigation as well as to minor children, if any, born out of the
wedlock. Harish Nagam from J abalpur, Madhya Pradesh
to Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh. Hence, this Court is of the view
that in cases, where the wife has reservations from trial on videoconferencing, it would be just and proper to transfer the proceedings from

one place to another, instead of compelling a trial by video-conferencing. There are no provisions of sending petitions by e-mail
and for its acceptance by Courts. 18) Moreover, in some cases, where there are pending litigations
between the parties in the place where the wife is residing as was the facts
In the case of Bharatiben Ravibhai (supra), where there was a pending
litigation at Dungarpur (Rajasthan), for which the matrimonial proceedings
was transferred or in one of the present case in hand, where the husband Is
a police personnel and the wife apprehends threat. /t Is
certainly difficult in video conferencing, if not impossible, to maintain
confidentiality. 77/2017 from the Court

of Principal Judge, Family Court, Silchar. She is a Doctor and
associated with works of National Rural Health Mission. 17/2016,

pending before the learned Court of District Judge, Bongaigaon,
which is a petition under Section 13(1)(i-a) and (i-b) of Hindu

other reliefs. Therefore, considering the un-denied
statement that the petitioner is contesting Misc. 17/2016,
pending before the learned Court of District J udge, Bongaigaon. The
respondent- wife has contested this application by filing Affidavit- inOpposition, claiming that the decree of divorce was obtained by
fraud. 148/2015 that the respondent has not been paid
any alimony or maintenance. Therefore, this court finds that this is not a
fit case for transfer of the proceeding. With the aforesaid observation, this application stands dismissed. It is stated that the
respondent Is a police personnel and has sufficient clout at Nagaon,
which is an intimidating factor for the petitioner to produce her
witnesses at Nagaon. It is submitted that she has recently joined as
a Teacher in Tezpur Govt. No one has
entered appearance for the respondent although notice was served
on his police station. 3262/16 is stated to be pending before
the learned Court of Chief J udicial Magistrate, Tezpur, this court is of
the view that the ratio of the case Bharatiben Ravibhal Rav (supra) \s
applicable. In this regard, it would be the duty of the petitioner to
produce a certified copy of this order before the learned Court of
District J udge, Nagaon for transfer of the said proceedings. As the
respondent herein has not entered appearance, the learned Court of
District Judge, Nagaon, shall fix the date of appearance of the
respondent (i.e. petitioner in T.S.(R) 72/16) before the learned Court
of District J udge, Sonitpur on 03.11.2017. The petitioner has prayed for transfer of the said case from
the learned Court of District Judge, Jorhat to the learned Court of
District J udge, Hojai. It is submitted that the petitioner had filed an
application under section 12 of the Protection of Women from
Domestic Violence Act, 2005, being D.V. Case No. It is submitted
that the T.S. (M) 7/2017 was filed to harass her. The learned District J udge,
Hojai, would be at liberty to transfer the case before any other

competent Court for trial. The
petitioner has prayed for transfer of the said case from the learned
Court of District Judge, Barpeta to the learned Court of Principal
Judge, Family Court, Kamrup (M), Guwahati. She was again compelled
to take shelter in her parental home and she filed F.C.(Crl) Case No. Considering the statement that the
petitioner is having no source of income and no one to escort her to
attend court proceedings at Barpeta, this Court is inclined to transfer
the proceedings of T.S. (M) 8/2017 from the learned Court of District
Judge, Barpeta to the learned Court of Principal J udge, Family Court,
Kamrup (M), Guwahati. It is
Submitted that the petitioner has no independent source of income
and has no one to escort her to Tinsukia. Therefore, in this case, this
Court finds that the ratio of the case Bharatiben Ravibhal Rav
(supra) is found to be applicable. The learned District Judge, Lakhimpur, North Lakhimpur,
would be at liberty to transfer the case before any other competent

Court (if any) for trial. Sri Subir Maitra - The petitioner/

wife is the defendant in T.S. (M) No. Considering the said statements this Court Is inclined to transfer the
proceedings of T.S. (M) No. 748/2016 under Section 13(1)(i-a) of the Hindu

the learned Counsels appearing for the respondents herein.

2) These petitions have been filed under Section 24 of the Civil
Procedure Code, by which cases relating to matrimonial disputes and/or
Guardianship dispute pending in various courts are sought to be transferred

from one District to another.

3) The reason for hearing all the matters together was deemed
necessitated in view of the recent judgment delivered by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India in the case of Krishna Veni Nagam vs. Harish Nagam
reported in (2017) 4 SCC 150. This judgment has been circulated to this
Court by the Registry of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. It would be

relevant to refer to paragraphs -13 to 20 thereof, which is extracted below:

“13. We have considered the above suggestions. /n this respect, we may
also refer to the doctrine of forum non conveniens which can be applied in
matrimonial proceedings for advancing interest of justice. Under the said
doctrine, the court exercises its inherent jurisdiction to stay proceedings at
a forum which Is considered not to be convenient and there is any other
forum which Is considered to be more convenient for the interest of all the
parties at the ends of justice. !1n Moai Entertainment Network and anr. Vv.
W.S.G. Cricket Pte. Ltal[(2003) 4 SCC 341] this Court observed:

“19. In Soiliada Maritime case[Soiliada Maritime Coron. V.
Cansulex Ltd, (1986) 3 All ER 843: 1987 AC 460 : (1986) 3 WLR
972(HL)] the House of Lords laid down the following jrinaple:

‘The fundamental princiole applicable to both the stay of
English proceedings on the ground that some other forum was the
appropriate forum and also the grant of leave to serve proceedings
out of the jurisdiction was that the court would choose that forum
in Which the case could be tried more suitably for the interest of all
the parties and for the ends of justice......”

The criteria to determine which was a more approorniate forum, for
the purpose of ordering stay of the suit, the court would look for
that forum with which the action had the most real and substantial
connection in terms of convenience or expense, availability of
witnesses, the law governing the relevant transaction and the
places where the parties resided or carried on business. If the court

Page 3 of 32
concluded that there was no other available forum which was more
appropriate than the English court, it would normally refuse a stay.
/f, however, the court concluded that there was another forum
Which was prima facie more appropriate, the court would normally
grant a stay unless there were arcumstances militating against a
Stay. /t was noted that as the alsoute concerning the contract in
Which the proper law was English law, it meant that England was
the appropriate forum in which the case could be more suitably
tried.”

Though these observations have been made in the context of
granting anti suit injunction, the principle can be followed in regulating the
exerase of jurisdiction of the court where proceedings are instituted. /n a
avil proceeding, the plaintiff is the dominus /itis but if more than one court
has jurisdiction, court can determine which Is the convenient forum and lay
down conaitions in the interest of justice subject to which its jurisdiction
may be availed. [Kusum Ingots & Alloys Lta. v. Union of India, (2004) 6 SCC
254, pata-30].

14, One cannot ignore the problem faced by a husband if proceedings are
transferred on account of genuine difficulties faced by the wife. The
husband may find it difficult to contest proceedings at a place which Is
convenient to the wife. Thus, transfer is not always a solution acceotable to
both the parties. !t may be appropriate that available technology of video
conferencing Is used where both the parties have egual difficulty and there
Is no place which is convenient to both the parties. We understand that in
every district in the country video conferencing Is now available. !n any
case, Wherever such facility is available, it ought to be fully utilized and all
the High Courts ought to issue appropriate administrative instructions to
regulate the use of video conferencing for certain category of cases.
Matrimonial cases where one of the parties resides outside court's
Jurisdiction is one of such categories. Wherever one or both the parties
make a request for use of video conference, proceedings may be conducted
on video conferencing, obviating the needs of the party to appear in person.
/n several cases, this Court has directed recording of evidence by video
conferencing. [State of Maharashtra v. Praful B. Desai, (2003) 4 SCC 601:
2003 SCC (Cri) 815; Kalyan Chandra Sarkar v. Rajesh Ranjan, (2005) 3 SCC
284; 2005 SCC (Cri) 705; Budhadev Karmaskar (4) v. State of W.B., (2011)
10 SCC 283 : (2012) 1 SCC (Cr) 285; Malthesh Gudda Pooja v. State of
Karnataka, (2011) 15 SCC 330: (2014) 2 SCC (Civ) 473].

15. The other difficulty faced by the parties living beyond the local
Jurisdiction of the court Is ignorance about availability of suitable legal
services. Legal Aid Committee of every district ought to make available
selected panel of advocates whose discipline and quality can be suitably
regulated and who are ready to provide legal aid at a specitied fee. Such
panels ought to be notified on the websites of the District Legal Services
Authorities/State Legal Services Authorities/National Legal Services
Authority. This may enhance access to justice consistent with Article 39A of
the Constitution.

16. The advancement of technology ought to be utilized also for service on
parties or receiving communication from the parties. Every district court
must have at least one e-mail 1D. Administrative instructions for directions
can be issued to permit the litigants to access the court, especially when
litigant Is located outside the local jurisdiction of the Court. A designated
officer/manager of a district court may suitably respond to such e-mail in

Page 4 of 32
the manner permitted as per the administrative instructions. Similarly, a
manager/ information officer in every alstrict court may be accessible on a
notified teleohone during notified hours as per the instructions. These steos
may, to some extent, take care of the problems of the litigants. These
suggestions may need attention of the High Courts.

17. We are thus of the view that it is necessary to issue certain directions
Which may provide alternative to seeking transfer of proceedings on
account of inability of a party to contest proceedings at a place away from
their ordinary residence on the ground that if proceedings are not
transferred it will result in denial of justice.

18 We, therefore direct that in matrimonial or custody matters or in
proceedings between parties to a marriage or arising out of adlsoutes
between parties to a marriage, wherever the defendants/ respondents are
located outside the jurisdiction of the court, the court where proceedings
are instituted may examine whether it Is in the interest of justice to
Incorporate any safeguards for ensuring that summoning” of
defendant/resoondent does not result in denial of Justice. Order
incorporating such safeguards may be sent along with the summons. The
safeguards can be:
I) Availability of video conferencing facility.

Il) Availability of legal aid service.

iii) Deoosit of cost for travel, lodging and boarding in terms of Order
XXV CPC.

IV) E-mail address/phone number, if any, at which litigant from out

station may communicate.

19. We hope the above arrangement may, to an extent, reduce hardship to
the litigants as noted above in the Order of this Court dated 9th /anuary,
2017. However, in the present case since the matter is pending in this Court
for about three years, we are satisfied that the prayer for transfer may be
allowed. Accordingly, we direct that proceedings in Case No.179A4/2013
under Section 13 of the Act titled “Harish Nagam vs. Krishna Veni Nagam”
pending on the file of 11 Presiding Judge, Family Court, /abalour, Madhya
Pradesh shall stand transferred to the Family Court, Hyderabad, Andhra
Pradesh. /f the parties seek meatation the transferee court may explore the
possibility of an amicable settlement through mediation. 1t will be open to
the transferee court to conduct the proceedings or record evidence of the
witnesses who are unable to appear in court by way of video conferencing.
Records shall be sent by court where proceedings are pending to the
transferee court forthwith.

20. The Registry to transmit a copy of this order to the courts concerned. A
copy of this order be sent to all the High Courts for aooropriate action.”

4) On enquiry, this Court has been informed that save and except four
districts of Assam, viz., N.C. Hills Autonomous District, Karbi Anglong
Autonomous District, Baska District and Chirang District, all other District
Courts have already set up with Video Conference facilities. Under the
aforesaid background, this Court deems fit that analogous hearing of this
cases be taken up so that there can be a threadbare discussion on the
matter. The various counsels for the petitioner’s side had voiced their
grievance regarding the adoptability of the Video Conference facilities for the
common public in the State of Assam, for which, the learned counsels for all
the petitioners had argued in favour of transfer of the matrimonial
proceedings instead of compelling the petitioners to accept the Video

Conference facility for trial of cases.

5) The following causes for their concern have been cited by the
learned counsels for the petitioners 
a. It is submitted that by and large in all cases, the wives who are in
distress and who were either driven out from the matrimonial home
or compelled to leave their matrimonial homes for variety of reasons,
are the petitioners herein. The petitioners have prayed for transfer of
the proceedings to the place where they are presently residing.

b. In majority of cases, the distressed wife, has no earning capacity.
They claim to be either dependent to their parents or their brothers
for their living. In many cases, the wives are also burdened to take
care of their minor children, their education and healthy growth, etc.
It is claimed that in many cases, the issue of maintenance have not
been settled, and even if any maintenance is allowed from their
estranged husband, the money awarded is a mere pittance, which is
not sufficient to take decent care of themselves, not to speak of
minor children.

c. It is submitted that being females, they have to face a great
difficulty to travel from their parental home to attend the Court in a

distant place away from their residence.

Page 6 of 32
d. The counsels have also asked this court to take notice of the
geographical situation of the State, further submitting that there are
three corners of the State and in order to travel from one corner of
the State to the other, it may take anything between 110-12 hours
to 24 hours by bus and by train. It is also submitted that few
Districts of the State stay inundated by flood water for 1-2 months in
a year for which normal life is disrupted for a total of 3-4 months
due to the annual calamity of flood. During these times, females not
only feel insecure for travelling alone in nigh-super and in trains, but
during these times of distress, as the male members of their parental
family are already having difficult times, they cannot spare time to
escort the females to court at a distant place.

e. It was submitted that the court should also take note of female
literacy in the State as well as the educational background of the
wives in each case before permitting trail by video-conferencing. It is
submitted that the uneducated and not too much technology savvy
ladies would find it difficult to conduct a trial under Video
Conferencing unless they are assisted by the equally tech-savvy
counsel. The ladies, who are left to be deprived without any legal
Support would find it very difficult to conduct a trial in Video
Conferencing.

f. It is also submitted that if trial by video- conferencing is allowed, the
ladies would have to bear with double financial burden, one for one
set of counsel for representing them before the trial court, to file
pleadings, petitions, documents, argument, and another set of
counsels at the Town/ City/ Sub-Division, where there are presently
residing to give legal counselling and to guide them through the
entire proceedings, to prepare written statement, evidence- onaffidavits. She would have to keep constant touch with both sets of
the counsel to keep herself updated about the dates posted in the

case and to monitor the date-wise progress of the case.

Page 7 of 32
g. It is submitted that even if trial is conducted by video-conferencing,
there is no denial that the lady would still be compelled to travel
from time to time to the town where the trial is taking place for the
purpose of paying fees of the counsel as well as for filing various
petitions requiring swearing of affidavit in support of the petitions,
unless this court completely waives the requirement of filing
petitions with original signature.

h. It is urged that a lady, who is financially starved and facing social
stigma connected with a lady whose husband has left her, and lack
of support from her own parental family, such a lady would be lucky
if she can engaged advocates at both her nearest court as well as
the town where litigation is filed. 1t would be still difficult to organize
two sets of unknown counsel to work in the tandem with each other
with the required coordination, because if the two sets of lawyers do
not coordinate with each other then, there are no chances of getting
a fair trial. There is a remote chance that a lady may get the service
of a counsel, who Is willing to take assignment only a date wise basis
without any continuity of engagement, because it is a common
practice that counsel is engaged for the entire life of litigation, and
no good counsel with some reputation would consent to take steps
only on as and when occasion arises. Therefore, if videoconferencing is allowed, there would be additional financial burden
on the wife to engage counsel at two different places, keep travelling
to and fro.

I. It is submitted that every lady is not staying in Towns/ City/ SubDivisional Towns, some of them would have to travel some distance
from their villages to reach the nearest Court having Videoconferencing facilities.

j. It is further argued that it would be a risky affair for a lady to send
the original documents by post to the town where litigation is going

on as it may get lost during transit.

Page 8 of 32
k. It is submitted that it would be equally risky for a lady to believe that
pleadings or petitions sent by post would reach the Court on time
and the office staff receiving post would promptly open postal
envelopes and tag such pleadings and petitions on record on the
date fixed. Therefore, unless the lady can successfully interact with
Presiding Officer of Court at around 10.30 am, she would not know
what would happen to her case in course of the day. Without
permitting interaction at a fixed time, no court would adjourn a case
merely because of postal delay.

|. The ground reality of lack of uninterrupted electricity supply, lack of
uninterrupted internet connectivity must also be addressed, as to
what would happen if on a particular day, due to mobile link failure,
electricity failure and internet link failure a remote station litigant
cannot get connected even over mobile phone to inform Court
Managers about internet/ mobile link failure. Examples were cited of
link failure in banks which stops all transactions including ATM
transactions, connectivity problems faced while e-filing of Income
Tax returns and GST returns in recent times, which became news

headlines.

6) It is also submitted that the judgment in Krishna Veni Nagam (supra)
was by a Division Bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, which had not overruled various orders by co-ordinate Bench of equal strength, whereby the
Hon’ble Supreme Court had deemed it fit to transfer matrimonial cases in the
place of choice of the wife. It is submitted that if permitted, they are ready
to refer to many cases where such cases were transferred. Hence, they
Submit that the case of Krishna Veni Nagarnisupora) should be treated as a
judgment per-incurium, which had not taken note of the previous orders by
co-ordinate Benches of equal strength, allowing transfer of matrimonial

CaSes.

Page 9 of 32
7) All the counsels for the petitioners’ side are unison in submitting that
trial by video- conferencing may be possible for some of the parties, but by
and large, unless such trial is started at an experimental basis in one or two
given case where parties are consenting, the permitting all trial by videoconferencing may not be the ideal solution for the State of Assam, which is
technologically not so advanced like metropolitan cities like Mumbai and New
Delhi.

8) Mr. PK Deka, the learned counsel for one of the petitioner has
Submitted that the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Krishna Veni
Nagam (supra) did not disturb the power and jurisdiction of this Court under
Section 24 CPC to transfer a suit from one court to another within its
jurisdiction in the State. He has submitted that the said judgment should be
considered to be prospective because of what was stated in paragraph-18
thereof. It is submitted that in this particular paragraph -18, the Hon’ble
Supreme Court was referring to incorporate safeguard for ensuring that
Summoning of defendants /respondents does not result in denial of justice
and therefore, ordered for safeguards to be mentioned while issuing of
Summonses. However, in his case, the summons stage was over and the trial
was going on. By citing various cases, where various High Courts in the
Country as well as the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India had transferred
matrimonial proceedings to the city/town where the wife was residing. He
specifically relies on the following four cases:

a. Rabinatra Kaur v. /itendra Singh, AlR 2000 SC 3403.

b. Sumita Singh Vs. Kumar Sanjay, AlR 2002 SC 396.

Cc. Durga Panalit Vs. Pradio Kumar Pandit, (2004) 1 GLT 440.

a. Pallavi Saikia Vs. Mriganka Bharall, (2006) SUPP GLT 425.

9) Mr. B. Chakraborty, the learned counsel appearing for one of the
petitioner has submitted that the case of Krishna Veni Nagam (suora) may
not be made applicable in these cases, firstly, because the Hon’ble Supreme

Court was passing an order under Section 25 CPC and it was not deciding

Page 10 of 32
the matter under Section 24 CPC. Moreover, the consistent views of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India as well as of the various High Court
including this Court that in respect of matrimonial cases, about the theory of
considering the convenience of wife had not been diluted in the case of

Krishna Veni Nagam (supra).

10) Mr. R. Sharma, the learned counsel appearing for one of the
petitioner has submitted that the husband is a police at the district of
Nagaon and therefore, he carries with him a clout in his hometown and
therefore, out of fear of the police husband, her witnesses may not be
inclined to give evidence at Nagaon and therefore, it is a fit case for transfer
of the proceeding to Tezpur in the district of Sonitpur. He also relies on the
case of Bharatiben Ravibhal Rav Vs. Ravibhal Govindbhal Rav decided on
05.05.2017 and reported in (2017) 6 SCC 785 to project that in the said
case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court did not deem it fit to permit Video
Conference and transfer the case from one district to another for the
convenience of wife and also considering the fact that when another
proceeding is pending between the parties in the courts where the wife is
residing and in this connection, he has submitted that at present three

separate proceedings initiated by the wife is currently pending at Tezpur.

11) Per contra, arguing in support of the idea of trial by video
conferencing, it is submitted that it is equally true for the husband to travel
to the place of choice of the wife and to face trial at a distant place. It is
Submitted that the husband are engaged in some service, profession,
business or other vocation to earn his livelihood. While it would not be
inconvenient for the wife to travel, if she is unemployed, but it would be very
difficult for the husband to avail leave to travel to attend matrimonial cases,
which is likely to affect the service carrier, business, profession or vocation.
It is submitted that in appropriate cases, if the problem faced by the wife is

genuine, the courts may, on case to case basis, order a reasonable cost of

Page 11 of 32
litigation, travel, lodging and food for the wife, children (if any), and an

escort.

12) Mr. Sishir Dutta, the learned senior counsel for one of the
respondent has referred to the case of MN. Murthy v. State of Karnataka,
(2003) 7 SCC 514 to argue that unless the order specifically provides for
prospective overruling, all judgments are deemed to have retrospective
effect and, as such, the argument by the learned counsel for the petitioners
that the case of Krishna Veni Nagam (supra) Nas prospective application is
not sustainable in view of the ratio laid down in the case of MN Murthy

(supra).

13) Mr. Saurav Kataki, the learned counsel for one of the respondent has
Submitted that Section 24 CPC is a procedural law and therefore, in a strict
sense, Section 24 is not a statutory law but a procedural law. It is submitted
that it is a well settled law that procedural law is a handmade of justice.
However, when the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India has given a direction as
to what procedure should be adopted in case of transfer of matrimonial suit,
In that case, the said decision becomes a law binding on all Courts and
Tribunals under the provisions of Article 141 of the Constitution of India.
Therefore, the discretion which was hitherto available to the High Court
while deciding the application filed under Section 24 CPC is no longer
available and a question of law will arise whether in light of the direction
contained in the case of Krishna Veni Nagam (supra), whether this Court has
the power or jurisdiction to carve out any exception. He further submits that
all other cases including the case of Bharatiben Ravibhal (supra), cited by
the counsels for various petitioners can be distinguished from the ratio of the
case in Krishna Veni Nagam (supra), because all other cases are judgment in
personam, but judgment in the case of Krishna Veni Nagam (supra),
because of being circulated to all the High Courts, should be treated a
judgment in rem and it should be mandatorily treated as a direction under
Article 141 of the Constitution of India.

Page 12 of 32
14) All the learned counsels for the parties have argued their respective
arguments but their submissions are consonance with the submission
already recorded above, it is not deemed necessary to reiterate those

arguments to burden this order.

15) Having considered the arguments made by all the learned counsels
in all the cases, this Court would like to state that it is not aloof from the
realities of life and that it is insensitive with the various problems the wives
have to face once they were driven out from the matrimonial house and the
inevitable social stigma and financial and mental anxiety suffered by her to
maintain a litigation as well as to minor children, if any, born out of the
wedlock. However, the majority of objections raised by the learned counsels
for the petitioners appeared to be answered by the Hon’ble Supreme Court
of India in pargarphs-14 to 18 of the case of Krishna Veni Nagam (supra),

which are already extracted above.

16) However, it must be noted that even in the case of Krishna Veni
Nagam (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India deemed it fit to transfer
the case of the husband, |.e. Harish Nagam from J abalpur, Madhya Pradesh
to Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh. Therefore, the question arises, that when
the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the said case of Krishna Veni Nagam
(supra), did not deem it fit not to transfer the matrimonial proceedings by
ordering trial by video-conferencing, and when the Hon'ble Supreme Court of
India in the subsequent case of Bharatiben Ravibhal Rav (supra), where the
matrimonial proceedings was transferred from Ahmedabad (Gujrat) to
Dungarpur (Rajasthan), there is no doubt that the Hon’ble Supreme Court of
India deemed it fit to exclude some cases from video-conferencing, where
the parties did not consent for such trial. Hence, this Court is of the view
that in cases, where the wife has reservations from trial on videoconferencing, it would be just and proper to transfer the proceedings from

one place to another, instead of compelling a trial by video-conferencing.

Page 13 of 32
17) This court has also taken note of the practical problems and
difficulties expressed by the learned counsels for the petitioners. To mention
a few, there is no provision under the Gauhati High Court Rules as well as
Civil Court Rules & Orders of the Gauhati High Court relating to trial by
video-conferencing. There are no provisions of sending petitions by e-mail
and for its acceptance by Courts. There is no provision to empower a trial
court to defer the proceedings merely because it receives communication
over phone call to Court Manager of by e-mail that pleadings or petitions had
been despatched by post. The subordinate Court staffs have not been
sensitized to promptly open postal envelopes and urgently tag the petitions
received by post in court record and to place them before the Court. The
Presiding Officers of the Courts are not yet sensitized to wait till such time in
the day till postal service is usually made to court premises, for which there
is every possibility that a court may pass orders in first half of the day and
the postal delivery containing petitions and pleadings being received after
orders are passed. There is no provisions in Gauhati High Court Rules as well
as Civil Court Rules & Orders of the Gauhati High Court about what would
happen if a party agreeing for trial by video-conference sends a pleading,
petition or document by post and the postal envelope is misplaced and what
would be the procedure for reconstruction of documents not received by
court, but lost in postal transit. There are no provisions in the Gauhati High
Court Rules as well as Civil Court Rules & Orders of the Gauhati High Court
to make a Court Manager as an agent for the out-station litigant, so as to
enable the Courts to accept submissions made by a Court Manager on the
basis of telephonic message or e-mail received from a litigant, and to pass
orders on the basis of any submissions made before the Court. The
procedure of regular trial by Video-conferencing, in the opinion of this court,
must be incorporated in the appropriate Rules governing trial like Gauhati
High Court Rules as well as Civil Court Rules & Orders of the Gauhati High
Court, because it is one thing to have an occasional session by Video
Conferencing like delivering judgment, one or two session of cross
Page 14 of 32
examination of accused who for various reasons like internal security, or to
maintain peace and tranquillity, is not desired to be moved from prison, or
video-conferencing with a hospitalized person, periodical viewing of undertrial accused lodged in jail by concerned Magistrates, etc., to name a few.
Therefore, it is hoped that in future, some of the issues are addressed by
this Court so that appropriate Rules are framed for facilitating video
conferencing, aS suggested by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India.

18) Moreover, in some cases, where there are pending litigations
between the parties in the place where the wife is residing as was the facts
In the case of Bharatiben Ravibhai (supra), where there was a pending
litigation at Dungarpur (Rajasthan), for which the matrimonial proceedings
was transferred or in one of the present case in hand, where the husband Is
a police personnel and the wife apprehends threat. This Court cannot shut

its eyes to such practical ground realities.

19) Moreover, it has come to the notice of this Court that the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India in the case of Santhini Vs. Vijaya Venketesh by an
order dated 09.08.2017 (Para-19), has referred the case of Krishna Veni
Nagam (supra) to the Hon’ble The Chief J ustice of India to consider referring
the said case before a larger Bench. The outcome of such reference is not

known. The relevant para of the said order is quoted below:
‘19. To what extent the confidence and confidentiality will be
safeguarded and protected in video conferencing, particularly when
efforts are taken by the counsellors, welfare experts, and for that
matter, the court itself for reconciliation, restitution of conjugal rights
or alssolution of marriage, ascertainment of the wishes of the child in
custody matters, etc, Is a serious issue to be considered. /t Is
certainly difficult in video conferencing, if not impossible, to maintain
confidentiality. It has also to be noted that the footage in video
conterenang becomes part of the record whereas the reconciiatory
efforts taken by the duty-holders referred to above are not meant to
be part of the record. All that aoart, in reconciiatory efforts, physical
presence of the parties would make a significant difference. Having
regard to the very object behind the establishment of Family Courts
Act, 1984, to Order XXXIIA of the Code of Civil Procedure and to the

Page 15 of 32
soedal provisions introduced in the Hindu Marriage Act under
Sections 22, 23 and 26, we are of the view that the airections Issued
by this Court in Krishna Veni Nagam (supra) need reconsideration on
the aspect of video conferencing in matrimonial disputes. ”

20) Therefore, in the overall view of the matter, as the case of Krishna
Veni Nagam (supra) does not lay down a law prohibiting transfer of any case
and instead follow the course of trial by video-conferencing, this court is of
the view that until some provisions are made in the Gauhati High Court Rules
as well as Civil Court Rules & Orders of the Gauhati High Court in respect of
full trial by video-conferencing, it would not be in the interest of the litigants
of the State of Assam to mandatorily undertake a full length trial by videoconferencing as an alternative of transfer of suits. The provisions of Section
24 CPC having not been struck-off, the power of this Court to exercise
jurisdiction under Section 24 CPC to transfer suits and proceedings cannot be
taken away in appropriate cases. In light of the various orders passed by the
Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in the various cases referred herein before,
with greatest respect to the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India, as the case of
Krishna Vent Nagam (supra) is under reconsideration of the said Hon'ble
Court and as even in the said judgment, the matrimonial case was indeed
transferred from Jabalpur to Hyderabad, in the absence of law laid down
curtailing the power of this Court to exercise jurisdiction under Section 24
CPC, this court is inclined to continue to exercise jurisdiction under Section
24 CPC.

21) With the aforesaid observations, the individual cases are now taken

up:
. IPPC) No. 14/2017 - Smt. Subarna Bhattacharjee Vs. Sri

Siddartha Biswas - \n this case, the petitioner- wife is seeking
transfer of proceedings of F.C.(C) Case No. 77/2017 from the Court
of Principal J udge, Family Court, Kamrup (M), Guwahati to the Court
of Principal Judge, Family Court, Silchar. She is a Doctor and
associated with works of National Rural Health Mission. She has a

Page 16 of 32
minor baby. Petitioner has no brother, but lives with aged parents.
She claims that marriage was solemnized at Silchar and after
marriage, she was living in their matrimonial home and Kolkata and
the case was filed at Guwahati to harass her and the Court at
Guwahati had no jurisdiction. In the affidavit in opposition, the
respondent has not denied that after marriage at Silchar, their
matrimonial home was not at Kolkata. Therefore, this court deems it
fit to transfer the proceedings of F.C.(C) Case No. 77/2017 from the
Court of Principal J udge, Family Court, Kamrup (M), Guwahati to the
Court of Principal J udge, Family Court, Silchar. The learned Court of
Principal J udge, Family Court, Kamrup (M), Guwahati shall transfer
the records of F.C.(C) Case No. 77/2017 to the Court of Principal
Judge, Family Court, Silchar. In this regard, it would be the duty of
the petitioner to produce a certified copy of this order before the
Court of Principal Judge, Family Court, Kamrup (M), Guwahati for
transfer of the said proceedings.

The parties, who are represented by their counsel, shall appear
before the Court of Principal J udge, Family Court, Cachar, Silchar, on
03.11.2017 without any further notice for appearance and by
producing certified copy of this order, shall seek further instruction

from the said learned Court.

7r.P.(C) No. 11/2017 - Maya Das (Thapa) Vs. Dipankar Das 
In this case, the petitioner/wife is the defendant in FC (Civil) Case
No.309/16 pending before the learned Principal J udge, Family Court,
Silchar, Cachar, which is a petition under Section 9 of the Hindu
Marriage Act, 1955. The petitioner has prayed for transfer of the
case from the Court of learned Principal J udge, Family Court, Cachar,
Silchar to the court of learned Principal Judge, Family Court at
Dimapur, Nagaland. In this case, this Court finds that this is a case
for the transfer from one State to another. In this regard, this Court

in the case of Porm Sengupta vs. Biswaj/it Senguota, (2015) 6 GLR

Page 17 of 32
396; (2016) 1 GLT 627, had discussed the jurisdiction of the Court
under Section 24 CPC and had laid down that this Court does not
have jurisdiction to make inter-State transfer of the suites and
proceedings. Therefore, such transfer, in the considered opinion of
this Court can only be made under Section 25 CPC. Therefore, by
following the precedent of the case of Porn’ Sengupta (supra), this
Court is not inclined to transfer the suit to outside the State although
Subordinate courts in the State of Nagaland are within the
jurisdiction of this Court, but still, it lies outside the State of Assam.
The parties, who are represented by their counsel, shall appear
before the Court of Principal J udge, Family Court, Cachar, Silchar, on
03.11.2017 without any further notice for appearance and by
producing certified copy of this order, shall seek further instruction

from the said learned Court.

7r.P.(C) No. 80/2016 - Mrs. Queen Hazarika Gogol Vs. Sri
Uttam Gogol - \n this case, the petitioner/wife is the defendant in

Misc. Case (G) No.1/15 pending before the court of learned District
Judge, Dibrugarh, which is a petition under Section 10 of the
Guardians and Wards Act, 1890. The petitioner has prayed for
transfer of the case from the court of learned District Judge,
Dibrugarh to the court of learned District Judge, Sivasagar. The
respondent/husband herein is reported to be a police personnel
serving aS a constable and the minor child (aged 4 years and 5
months, aS no 16.02.2015, the date of filing of the guardianship
petition) is now residing with the petitioner/wife. Moreover, the
petitioner has claimed that she has become entitled to receive
maintenance from the husband as per the order passed by the
learned Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Nazira in Misc. Case
No.2/2014 filed under Section 125 Cr.P.C. (at one place also
mentioned as order passed by the learned Munsiff-cuny] udicial

Magistrate, First Class, Nazira). It appears that the respondent had

Page 18 of 32
also instituted Criminal Revision No.8(1)/2015 before the learned
Sessions J udge, Sivasagar. Therefore, in this case, this Court finds
that the ratio of the case Bharatiben Ravibhai Rav (supra) is found to
be applicable. Therefore, the proceedings of the Misc. Case (G)
No.1/15 under Section 10 of the Guardians and Wards Act pending
in the court of learned District J udge, Dibrugarh is transferred to the
learned District J udge, Sivasagar, who will have power to delegate it
to another appropriate and competent court.

The learned Court of District Judge, Dibrugarh shall transfer
the records of Misc. Case (G) No.1/15 to the learned Court of District
Judge, Sivasagar. In this regard, it would be the duty of the
petitioner to produce a certified copy of this order before the learned
Court of District Judge, Dibrugarh for transfer of the said
proceedings.

The parties, who are represented by their learned counsels are
directed to appear in person or through duly instructed pleader
before the court of the learned District Judge, Dibrguarh on
03.11.2017 and by producing a certified copy of this order, shall

seek further instruction from the said learned court.

Tr.P.(C) No. 77/2016 - Kabita Baid Vs. Dharamchand Baid The petitioner/ wife is the defendant in T.S.(D) No. 17/2016,

pending before the learned Court of District Judge, Bongaigaon,
which is a petition under Section 13(1)(i-a) and (i-b) of Hindu
Marriage Act, 1955, seeking dissolution of marriage by divorce and
other reliefs. The petitioner has prayed for transfer of the said case
from the learned Court of District Judge, Bongaigaon to the learned
Court of Principal J udge, Family Court, Kamrup (M), Guwahati. It Is
stated that the petitioner has shifted her residence from Kokrajhar to
Guwahati for better treatment as she is suffering from “Prolapse
Intervertebral Disc”. She also had to shift her place of residence

from her parental home because her status as a lady living

Page 19 of 32
V.

separately from husband without any children is causing stigma to
the family, which is hindering the marriage of her sister. The
respondent has contested the case by filing Affidavit- in- opposition,
Stating that the petitioner is contesting Misc. Case No. 42/2016,
which is an application under section 125 Cr.P.C. at Bongaigaon. It is
also stated that the respondent is an orthopedically challenged
person who cannot move without an escort and for the said purpose,
the respondent has relied on a concession certificate annexed to his
affidavit- in- opposition. Therefore, considering the un-denied
statement that the petitioner is contesting Misc. Case No. 42/2016,
under section 125 Cr.P.C. at Bongaigaon and that the respondent is
an orthopedically challenged person, and on further considering the
fact that the respondent has sought for transfer only because she
has changed her residence, this Court is of the view that this is not a
fit case for the transfer of the proceedings of T.S.(D) No. 17/2016,
pending before the learned Court of District J udge, Bongaigaon. In
this case, this Court finds that the ratio of the case Bharatiben
Ravibhal Rav (supra) \s found to be applicable as the petitioner is
pursuing Misc. Case No. 46/2016 under Section 125 Cr.P.C. at
Bongaigaon. Hence, this application stands dismissed.

The parties, who are represented by their learned counsels are
directed to appear in person or through duly instructed pleader
before the court of the Court of the learned District Judge,
Bongaigaon on 03.11.2017 and by producing a certified copy of

this order, shall seek further instruction from the said learned court.

7r.P.(C) No. 25/2016 - Sri Sumit Ranjan Nath Vs. Smt.

Suchita Nath - The petitioner- husband is seeking transfer of the
proceedings of TS 93/2013 from the learned Court of District J udge,
Karimganj to the Court of Principal J udge, Family Court, Kamrup (M),
Guwahati. It is projected that TS 96/2013 between the parties was
compromised and disposed of by order dated 09.06.2014 passed by

Page 20 of 32
Vi.

the learned District J udge, Karimganj, by which the parties agreed to
live a conjugal life. But the same did not last. Thereafter, a decree of
divorce was validly passed by the learned Court of Principal J udge,
Family Court, Guwahati by order dated 08.09.2015 in F.C.(Civil) Case
No. 148/15. However, despite the decree, the respondent- wife has
filed Title (Restitution) Suit No. 14/2016 under section 9 of the Hindu
Marriage Act, 1955 before the learned Court of District J udge,
Karimganj, again seeking restitution of conjugal rights. The
petitioner is a personnel of Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB). The
respondent- wife has contested this application by filing Affidavit- inOpposition, claiming that the decree of divorce was obtained by
fraud. On perusal of the petition for divorce, being F.C.(C) 148/2015
as well as the agreement dated 29.06.2015 for divorce, both filed by
the respondent and copy of order dated 08.09.2015 passed in
F.C.(C) Case No. 148/2015 that the respondent has not been paid
any alimony or maintenance. The petitioner being a member of
Sashastra Seema Bal, can undertake the journey to Karimganj, but it
would be extremely difficult for the respondent to travel from
Karimganj to Guwahati. Therefore, this court finds that this is not a
fit case for transfer of the proceeding.

However, considering the submissions made by the learned
counsel for the petitioner that there is a decree of divorce operating,
the petitioner is permitted to move the learned Court of District
Judge, Karimganj with an appropriate application for considering the
maintainability of the Title (Restitution) Suit No. 14/2016. Till the
decision thereon, the petitioner shall also be at liberty to move the
said learned court for exemption from any personal appearance.

With the aforesaid observation, this application stands dismissed.

Tr.P.(C) No. 34/2017 - Smt. Anamika Gogoi Vs. Sr Manoj

Saikia - The petitioner/ wife is the defendant in Mat. Suit
(Restitution) No. 72/2016, pending before the learned Court of

Page 21 of 32
District J udge, Nagaon. The petitioner has prayed for transfer of the
said case from the learned Court of District Judge, Nagaon to the
learned Court of District J udge, Sonitpur, Tezpur. It is stated that the
respondent Is a police personnel and has sufficient clout at Nagaon,
which is an intimidating factor for the petitioner to produce her
witnesses at Nagaon. It is submitted that she has recently joined as

Jurisdiction is one of such categories. The advancement of technology ought to be utilized also for service on
parties or receiving communication from the parties. Every district court
must have at least one e-mail 1D. Administrative instructions for directions
can be issued to permit the litigants to access the court, especially when
litigant Is located outside the local jurisdiction of the Court. Order
incorporating such safeguards may be sent along with the summons. The
safeguards can be:

geographical situation of the State, further submitting that there are
three corners of the State and in order to travel from one corner of
the State to the other, it may take anything between 110-12 hours
to 24 hours by bus and by train. e. It was submitted that the court should also take note of female
literacy in the State as well as the educational background of the
wives in each case before permitting trail by video-conferencing. f. It is also submitted that if trial by video- conferencing is allowed, the
ladies would have to bear with double financial burden, one for one
set of counsel for representing them before the trial court, to file
pleadings, petitions, documents, argument, and another set of
counsels at the Town/ City/ Sub-Division, where there are presently
residing to give legal counselling and to guide them through the
entire proceedings, to prepare written statement, evidence- onaffidavits. Page 8 of 32

pleadings or petitions sent by post would reach the Court on time
and the office staff receiving post would promptly open postal
envelopes and tag such pleadings and petitions on record on the
date fixed. 8) Mr. PK Deka, the learned counsel for one of the petitioner has
Submitted that the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Krishna Veni
Nagam (supra) did not disturb the power and jurisdiction of this Court under
Section 24 CPC to transfer a suit from one court to another within its
jurisdiction in the State. He has submitted that the said judgment should be
considered to be prospective because of what was stated in paragraph-18
thereof. However, in his case, the summons stage was over and the trial
was going on. Moreover, the consistent views of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India as well as of the various High Court
including this Court that in respect of matrimonial cases, about the theory of
considering the convenience of wife had not been diluted in the case of

Krishna Veni Nagam (supra). 10) Mr. R. Sharma, the learned counsel appearing for one of the
petitioner has submitted that the husband is a police at the district of
Nagaon and therefore, he carries with him a clout in his hometown and
therefore, out of fear of the police husband, her witnesses may not be
inclined to give evidence at Nagaon and therefore, it is a fit case for transfer
of the proceeding to Tezpur in the district of Sonitpur. It is submitted
that it is a well settled law that procedural law is a handmade of justice. Therefore, the discretion which was hitherto available to the High Court
while deciding the application filed under Section 24 CPC is no longer
available and a question of law will arise whether in light of the direction
contained in the case of Krishna Veni Nagam (supra), whether this Court has
the power or jurisdiction to carve out any exception. He further submits that
all other cases including the case of Bharatiben Ravibhal (supra), cited by
the counsels for various petitioners can be distinguished from the ratio of the
case in Krishna Veni Nagam (supra), because all other cases are judgment in
personam, but judgment in the case of Krishna Veni Nagam (supra),
because of being circulated to all the High Courts, should be treated a
judgment in rem and it should be mandatorily treated as a direction under
Article 141 of the Constitution of India. 15) Having considered the arguments made by all the learned counsels
in all the cases, this Court would like to state that it is not aloof from the
realities of life and that it is insensitive with the various problems the wives
have to face once they were driven out from the matrimonial house and the
inevitable social stigma and financial and mental anxiety suffered by her to
maintain a litigation as well as to minor children, if any, born out of the
wedlock. Harish Nagam from J abalpur, Madhya Pradesh
to Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh. Hence, this Court is of the view
that in cases, where the wife has reservations from trial on videoconferencing, it would be just and proper to transfer the proceedings from

one place to another, instead of compelling a trial by video-conferencing. There are no provisions of sending petitions by e-mail
and for its acceptance by Courts. 18) Moreover, in some cases, where there are pending litigations
between the parties in the place where the wife is residing as was the facts
In the case of Bharatiben Ravibhai (supra), where there was a pending
litigation at Dungarpur (Rajasthan), for which the matrimonial proceedings

application under section 12 of the Protection of Women from
Domestic Violence Act, 2005, being D.V. Case No. It is submitted
that the T.S. (M) 7/2017 was filed to harass her. The learned District J udge,
Hojai, would be at liberty to transfer the case before any other

competent Court for trial. The
petitioner has prayed for transfer of the said case from the learned
Court of District Judge, Barpeta to the learned Court of Principal
Judge, Family Court, Kamrup (M), Guwahati. She was again compelled
to take shelter in her parental home and she filed F.C.(Crl) Case No. Considering the statement that the
petitioner is having no source of income and no one to escort her to
attend court proceedings at Barpeta, this Court is inclined to transfer
the proceedings of T.S. (M) 8/2017 from the learned Court of District
Judge, Barpeta to the learned Court of Principal J udge, Family Court,
Kamrup (M), Guwahati. It is
Submitted that the petitioner has no independent source of income
and has no one to escort her to Tinsukia. Therefore, in this case, this
Court finds that the ratio of the case Bharatiben Ravibhal Rav
(supra) is found to be applicable. The learned District Judge, Lakhimpur, North Lakhimpur,
would be at liberty to transfer the case before any other competent

Court (if any) for trial. Sri Subir Maitra - The petitioner/

wife is the defendant in T.S. (M) No. Considering the said statements this Court Is inclined to transfer the
proceedings of T.S. (M) No. 748/2016 under Section 13(1)(i-a) of the Hindu
Marriage Act, 1955 for dissolution of marriage. The petitioner has
prayed for transfer of the said case from the learned Court of
Principal J udge, Family Court, Kamrup (M), Guwahati to the learned
Court of District Judge, Jorhat. The parties, who are represented by their respective learned
counsels are directed to appear in person or through duly instructed
pleader before the court of the learned District Judge, Jorhat, on
03.11.2017 and by producing a certified copy of this order, shall
seek further instruction from the said learned court. The parties have a minor girl
child as their only issue, which is now living with the petitioner. The petitioner has filed a case for
seeking maintenance, which is numbered as Misc. It is submitted
that the petitioner has no independent source of income and as her
parents are aged, she has no one to escort her to Guwahati to
attend the Court proceedings.","THE GAUHATI HIGH COURT

the learned Counsels appearing for the respondents herein.

2) These petitions have been filed under Section 24 of the Civil
Procedure Code, by which cases relating to matrimonial disputes and/or
Guardianship dispute pending in various courts are sought to be transferred

from one District to another.

3) The reason for hearing all the matters together was deemed
necessitated in view of the recent judgment delivered by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India in the case of Krishna Veni Nagam vs. Harish Nagam
reported in (2017) 4 SCC 150. This judgment has been circulated to this
Court by the Registry of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. It would be

relevant to refer to paragraphs -13 to 20 thereof, which is extracted below:

“13. We have considered the above suggestions. /n this respect, we may
also refer to the doctrine of forum non conveniens which can be applied in
matrimonial proceedings for advancing interest of justice. Under the said
doctrine, the court exercises its inherent jurisdiction to stay proceedings at
a forum which Is considered not to be convenient and there is any other
forum which Is considered to be more convenient for the interest of all the
parties at the ends of justice. !1n Moai Entertainment Network and anr. Vv.
W.S.G. Cricket Pte. Ltal[(2003) 4 SCC 341] this Court observed:

“19. In Soiliada Maritime case[Soiliada Maritime Coron. V.
Cansulex Ltd, (1986) 3 All ER 843: 1987 AC 460 : (1986) 3 WLR
972(HL)] the House of Lords laid down the following jrinaple:

‘The fundamental princiole applicable to both the stay of
English proceedings on the ground that some other forum was the
appropriate forum and also the grant of leave to serve proceedings
out of the jurisdiction was that the court would choose that forum
in Which the case could be tried more suitably for the interest of all
the parties and for the ends of justice......”

The criteria to determine which was a more approorniate forum, for
the purpose of ordering stay of the suit, the court would look for
that forum with which the action had the most real and substantial
connection in terms of convenience or expense, availability of
witnesses, the law governing the relevant transaction and the
places where the parties resided or carried on business. If the court

Page 3 of 32
concluded that there was no other available forum which was more
appropriate than the English court, it would normally refuse a stay.
/f, however, the court concluded that there was another forum
Which was prima facie more appropriate, the court would normally
grant a stay unless there were arcumstances militating against a
Stay. /t was noted that as the alsoute concerning the contract in
Which the proper law was English law, it meant that England was
the appropriate forum in which the case could be more suitably
tried.”

Though these observations have been made in the context of
granting anti suit injunction, the principle can be followed in regulating the
exerase of jurisdiction of the court where proceedings are instituted. /n a
avil proceeding, the plaintiff is the dominus /itis but if more than one court
has jurisdiction, court can determine which Is the convenient forum and lay
down conaitions in the interest of justice subject to which its jurisdiction
may be availed. [Kusum Ingots & Alloys Lta. v. Union of India, (2004) 6 SCC
254, pata-30].

14, One cannot ignore the problem faced by a husband if proceedings are
transferred on account of genuine difficulties faced by the wife. The
husband may find it difficult to contest proceedings at a place which Is
convenient to the wife. Thus, transfer is not always a solution acceotable to
both the parties. !t may be appropriate that available technology of video
conferencing Is used where both the parties have egual difficulty and there
Is no place which is convenient to both the parties. We understand that in
every district in the country video conferencing Is now available. !n any
case, Wherever such facility is available, it ought to be fully utilized and all
the High Courts ought to issue appropriate administrative instructions to
regulate the use of video conferencing for certain category of cases.
Matrimonial cases where one of the parties resides outside court's
Jurisdiction is one of such categories. Wherever one or both the parties
make a request for use of video conference, proceedings may be conducted
on video conferencing, obviating the needs of the party to appear in person.
/n several cases, this Court has directed recording of evidence by video
conferencing. [State of Maharashtra v. Praful B. Desai, (2003) 4 SCC 601:
2003 SCC (Cri) 815; Kalyan Chandra Sarkar v. Rajesh Ranjan, (2005) 3 SCC
284; 2005 SCC (Cri) 705; Budhadev Karmaskar (4) v. State of W.B., (2011)
10 SCC 283 : (2012) 1 SCC (Cr) 285; Malthesh Gudda Pooja v. State of
Karnataka, (2011) 15 SCC 330: (2014) 2 SCC (Civ) 473].

15. The other difficulty faced by the parties living beyond the local
Jurisdiction of the court Is ignorance about availability of suitable legal
services. Legal Aid Committee of every district ought to make available
selected panel of advocates whose discipline and quality can be suitably
regulated and who are ready to provide legal aid at a specitied fee. Such
panels ought to be notified on the websites of the District Legal Services
Authorities/State Legal Services Authorities/National Legal Services
Authority. This may enhance access to justice consistent with Article 39A of
the Constitution.

16. The advancement of technology ought to be utilized also for service on
parties or receiving communication from the parties. Every district court
must have at least one e-mail 1D. Administrative instructions for directions
can be issued to permit the litigants to access the court, especially when
litigant Is located outside the local jurisdiction of the Court. A designated
officer/manager of a district court may suitably respond to such e-mail in

Page 4 of 32
the manner permitted as per the administrative instructions. Similarly, a
manager/ information officer in every alstrict court may be accessible on a
notified teleohone during notified hours as per the instructions. These steos
may, to some extent, take care of the problems of the litigants. These
suggestions may need attention of the High Courts.

17. We are thus of the view that it is necessary to issue certain directions
Which may provide alternative to seeking transfer of proceedings on
account of inability of a party to contest proceedings at a place away from
their ordinary residence on the ground that if proceedings are not
transferred it will result in denial of justice.

18 We, therefore direct that in matrimonial or custody matters or in
proceedings between parties to a marriage or arising out of adlsoutes
between parties to a marriage, wherever the defendants/ respondents are
located outside the jurisdiction of the court, the court where proceedings
are instituted may examine whether it Is in the interest of justice to
Incorporate any safeguards for ensuring that summoning” of
defendant/resoondent does not result in denial of Justice. Order
incorporating such safeguards may be sent along with the summons. The
safeguards can be:
I) Availability of video conferencing facility.

Il) Availability of legal aid service.

iii) Deoosit of cost for travel, lodging and boarding in terms of Order
XXV CPC.

IV) E-mail address/phone number, if any, at which litigant from out

station may communicate.

19. We hope the above arrangement may, to an extent, reduce hardship to
the litigants as noted above in the Order of this Court dated 9th /anuary,
2017. However, in the present case since the matter is pending in this Court
for about three years, we are satisfied that the prayer for transfer may be
allowed. Accordingly, we direct that proceedings in Case No.179A4/2013
under Section 13 of the Act titled “Harish Nagam vs. Krishna Veni Nagam”
pending on the file of 11 Presiding Judge, Family Court, /abalour, Madhya
Pradesh shall stand transferred to the Family Court, Hyderabad, Andhra
Pradesh. /f the parties seek meatation the transferee court may explore the
possibility of an amicable settlement through mediation. 1t will be open to
the transferee court to conduct the proceedings or record evidence of the
witnesses who are unable to appear in court by way of video conferencing.
Records shall be sent by court where proceedings are pending to the
transferee court forthwith.

20. The Registry to transmit a copy of this order to the courts concerned. A
copy of this order be sent to all the High Courts for aooropriate action.”

Page 5 of 32
4) On enquiry, this Court has been informed that save and except four
districts of Assam, viz., N.C. Hills Autonomous District, Karbi Anglong
Autonomous District, Baska District and Chirang District, all other District
Courts have already set up with Video Conference facilities. Under the
aforesaid background, this Court deems fit that analogous hearing of this
cases be taken up so that there can be a threadbare discussion on the
matter. The various counsels for the petitioner’s side had voiced their
grievance regarding the adoptability of the Video Conference facilities for the
common public in the State of Assam, for which, the learned counsels for all
the petitioners had argued in favour of transfer of the matrimonial
proceedings instead of compelling the petitioners to accept the Video

Conference facility for trial of cases.

5) The following causes for their concern have been cited by the
learned counsels for the petitioners 
a. It is submitted that by and large in all cases, the wives who are in
distress and who were either driven out from the matrimonial home
or compelled to leave their matrimonial homes for variety of reasons,
are the petitioners herein. The petitioners have prayed for transfer of
the proceedings to the place where they are presently residing.

b. In majority of cases, the distressed wife, has no earning capacity.
They claim to be either dependent to their parents or their brothers
for their living. In many cases, the wives are also burdened to take
care of their minor children, their education and healthy growth, etc.
It is claimed that in many cases, the issue of maintenance have not
been settled, and even if any maintenance is allowed from their
estranged husband, the money awarded is a mere pittance, which is
not sufficient to take decent care of themselves, not to speak of
minor children.

c. It is submitted that being females, they have to face a great
difficulty to travel from their parental home to attend the Court in a

distant place away from their residence.

Page 6 of 32
d. The counsels have also asked this court to take notice of the
geographical situation of the State, further submitting that there are
three corners of the State and in order to travel from one corner of
the State to the other, it may take anything between 110-12 hours
to 24 hours by bus and by train. It is also submitted that few
Districts of the State stay inundated by flood water for 1-2 months in
a year for which normal life is disrupted for a total of 3-4 months
due to the annual calamity of flood. During these times, females not
only feel insecure for travelling alone in nigh-super and in trains, but
during these times of distress, as the male members of their parental
family are already having difficult times, they cannot spare time to
escort the females to court at a distant place.

e. It was submitted that the court should also take note of female
literacy in the State as well as the educational background of the
wives in each case before permitting trail by video-conferencing. It is
submitted that the uneducated and not too much technology savvy
ladies would find it difficult to conduct a trial under Video
Conferencing unless they are assisted by the equally tech-savvy
counsel. The ladies, who are left to be deprived without any legal
Support would find it very difficult to conduct a trial in Video
Conferencing.

f. It is also submitted that if trial by video- conferencing is allowed, the
ladies would have to bear with double financial burden, one for one
set of counsel for representing them before the trial court, to file
pleadings, petitions, documents, argument, and another set of
counsels at the Town/ City/ Sub-Division, where there are presently
residing to give legal counselling and to guide them through the
entire proceedings, to prepare written statement, evidence- onaffidavits. She would have to keep constant touch with both sets of
the counsel to keep herself updated about the dates posted in the

case and to monitor the date-wise progress of the case.

Page 7 of 32
g. It is submitted that even if trial is conducted by video-conferencing,
there is no denial that the lady would still be compelled to travel
from time to time to the town where the trial is taking place for the
purpose of paying fees of the counsel as well as for filing various
petitions requiring swearing of affidavit in support of the petitions,
unless this court completely waives the requirement of filing
petitions with original signature.

h. It is urged that a lady, who is financially starved and facing social
stigma connected with a lady whose husband has left her, and lack
of support from her own parental family, such a lady would be lucky
if she can engaged advocates at both her nearest court as well as
the town where litigation is filed. 1t would be still difficult to organize
two sets of unknown counsel to work in the tandem with each other
with the required coordination, because if the two sets of lawyers do
not coordinate with each other then, there are no chances of getting
a fair trial. There is a remote chance that a lady may get the service
of a counsel, who Is willing to take assignment only a date wise basis
without any continuity of engagement, because it is a common
practice that counsel is engaged for the entire life of litigation, and
no good counsel with some reputation would consent to take steps
only on as and when occasion arises. Therefore, if videoconferencing is allowed, there would be additional financial burden
on the wife to engage counsel at two different places, keep travelling
to and fro.

I. It is submitted that every lady is not staying in Towns/ City/ SubDivisional Towns, some of them would have to travel some distance
from their villages to reach the nearest Court having Videoconferencing facilities.

j. It is further argued that it would be a risky affair for a lady to send
the original documents by post to the town where litigation is going

on as it may get lost during transit.

Page 8 of 32
k. It is submitted that it would be equally risky for a lady to believe that
pleadings or petitions sent by post would reach the Court on time
and the office staff receiving post would promptly open postal
envelopes and tag such pleadings and petitions on record on the
date fixed. Therefore, unless the lady can successfully interact with
Presiding Officer of Court at around 10.30 am, she would not know
what would happen to her case in course of the day. Without
permitting interaction at a fixed time, no court would adjourn a case
merely because of postal delay.

|. The ground reality of lack of uninterrupted electricity supply, lack of
uninterrupted internet connectivity must also be addressed, as to
what would happen if on a particular day, due to mobile link failure,
electricity failure and internet link failure a remote station litigant
cannot get connected even over mobile phone to inform Court
Managers about internet/ mobile link failure. Examples were cited of
link failure in banks which stops all transactions including ATM
transactions, connectivity problems faced while e-filing of Income
Tax returns and GST returns in recent times, which became news

headlines.

6) It is also submitted that the judgment in Krishna Veni Nagam (supra)
was by a Division Bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, which had not overruled various orders by co-ordinate Bench of equal strength, whereby the
Hon’ble Supreme Court had deemed it fit to transfer matrimonial cases in the
place of choice of the wife. It is submitted that if permitted, they are ready
to refer to many cases where such cases were transferred. Hence, they
Submit that the case of Krishna Veni Nagarnisupora) should be treated as a
judgment per-incurium, which had not taken note of the previous orders by
co-ordinate Benches of equal strength, allowing transfer of matrimonial

CaSes.

Page 9 of 32
7) All the counsels for the petitioners’ side are unison in submitting that
trial by video- conferencing may be possible for some of the parties, but by
and large, unless such trial is started at an experimental basis in one or two
given case where parties are consenting, the permitting all trial by videoconferencing may not be the ideal solution for the State of Assam, which is
technologically not so advanced like metropolitan cities like Mumbai and New
Delhi.

8) Mr. PK Deka, the learned counsel for one of the petitioner has
Submitted that the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Krishna Veni
Nagam (supra) did not disturb the power and jurisdiction of this Court under
Section 24 CPC to transfer a suit from one court to another within its
jurisdiction in the State. He has submitted that the said judgment should be
considered to be prospective because of what was stated in paragraph-18
thereof. It is submitted that in this particular paragraph -18, the Hon’ble
Supreme Court was referring to incorporate safeguard for ensuring that
Summoning of defendants /respondents does not result in denial of justice
and therefore, ordered for safeguards to be mentioned while issuing of
Summonses. However, in his case, the summons stage was over and the trial
was going on. By citing various cases, where various High Courts in the
Country as well as the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India had transferred
matrimonial proceedings to the city/town where the wife was residing. He
specifically relies on the following four cases:

a. Rabinatra Kaur v. /itendra Singh, AlR 2000 SC 3403.

b. Sumita Singh Vs. Kumar Sanjay, AlR 2002 SC 396.

Cc. Durga Panalit Vs. Pradio Kumar Pandit, (2004) 1 GLT 440.

a. Pallavi Saikia Vs. Mriganka Bharall, (2006) SUPP GLT 425.

9) Mr. B. Chakraborty, the learned counsel appearing for one of the
petitioner has submitted that the case of Krishna Veni Nagam (suora) may
not be made applicable in these cases, firstly, because the Hon’ble Supreme

Court was passing an order under Section 25 CPC and it was not deciding

Page 10 of 32
the matter under Section 24 CPC. Moreover, the consistent views of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India as well as of the various High Court
including this Court that in respect of matrimonial cases, about the theory of
considering the convenience of wife had not been diluted in the case of

Krishna Veni Nagam (supra).

10) Mr. R. Sharma, the learned counsel appearing for one of the
petitioner has submitted that the husband is a police at the district of
Nagaon and therefore, he carries with him a clout in his hometown and
therefore, out of fear of the police husband, her witnesses may not be
inclined to give evidence at Nagaon and therefore, it is a fit case for transfer
of the proceeding to Tezpur in the district of Sonitpur. He also relies on the
case of Bharatiben Ravibhal Rav Vs. Ravibhal Govindbhal Rav decided on
05.05.2017 and reported in (2017) 6 SCC 785 to project that in the said
case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court did not deem it fit to permit Video
Conference and transfer the case from one district to another for the
convenience of wife and also considering the fact that when another
proceeding is pending between the parties in the courts where the wife is
residing and in this connection, he has submitted that at present three

separate proceedings initiated by the wife is currently pending at Tezpur.

11) Per contra, arguing in support of the idea of trial by video
conferencing, it is submitted that it is equally true for the husband to travel
to the place of choice of the wife and to face trial at a distant place. It is
Submitted that the husband are engaged in some service, profession,
business or other vocation to earn his livelihood. While it would not be
inconvenient for the wife to travel, if she is unemployed, but it would be very
difficult for the husband to avail leave to travel to attend matrimonial cases,
which is likely to affect the service carrier, business, profession or vocation.
It is submitted that in appropriate cases, if the problem faced by the wife is

genuine, the courts may, on case to case basis, order a reasonable cost of

Page 11 of 32
litigation, travel, lodging and food for the wife, children (if any), and an

escort.

12) Mr. Sishir Dutta, the learned senior counsel for one of the
respondent has referred to the case of MN. Murthy v. State of Karnataka,
(2003) 7 SCC 514 to argue that unless the order specifically provides for
prospective overruling, all judgments are deemed to have retrospective
effect and, as such, the argument by the learned counsel for the petitioners
that the case of Krishna Veni Nagam (supra) Nas prospective application is
not sustainable in view of the ratio laid down in the case of MN Murthy

(supra).

13) Mr. Saurav Kataki, the learned counsel for one of the respondent has
Submitted that Section 24 CPC is a procedural law and therefore, in a strict
sense, Section 24 is not a statutory law but a procedural law. It is submitted
that it is a well settled law that procedural law is a handmade of justice.
However, when the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India has given a direction as
to what procedure should be adopted in case of transfer of matrimonial suit,
In that case, the said decision becomes a law binding on all Courts and
Tribunals under the provisions of Article 141 of the Constitution of India.
Therefore, the discretion which was hitherto available to the High Court
while deciding the application filed under Section 24 CPC is no longer
available and a question of law will arise whether in light of the direction
contained in the case of Krishna Veni Nagam (supra), whether this Court has
the power or jurisdiction to carve out any exception. He further submits that
all other cases including the case of Bharatiben Ravibhal (supra), cited by
the counsels for various petitioners can be distinguished from the ratio of the
case in Krishna Veni Nagam (supra), because all other cases are judgment in
personam, but judgment in the case of Krishna Veni Nagam (supra),
because of being circulated to all the High Courts, should be treated a
judgment in rem and it should be mandatorily treated as a direction under
Article 141 of the Constitution of India.

Page 12 of 32
14) All the learned counsels for the parties have argued their respective
arguments but their submissions are consonance with the submission
already recorded above, it is not deemed necessary to reiterate those

arguments to burden this order.

15) Having considered the arguments made by all the learned counsels
in all the cases, this Court would like to state that it is not aloof from the
realities of life and that it is insensitive with the various problems the wives
have to face once they were driven out from the matrimonial house and the
inevitable social stigma and financial and mental anxiety suffered by her to
maintain a litigation as well as to minor children, if any, born out of the
wedlock. However, the majority of objections raised by the learned counsels
for the petitioners appeared to be answered by the Hon’ble Supreme Court
of India in pargarphs-14 to 18 of the case of Krishna Veni Nagam (supra),

which are already extracted above.

16) However, it must be noted that even in the case of Krishna Veni
Nagam (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India deemed it fit to transfer
the case of the husband, |.e. Harish Nagam from J abalpur, Madhya Pradesh
to Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh. Therefore, the question arises, that when
the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the said case of Krishna Veni Nagam
(supra), did not deem it fit not to transfer the matrimonial proceedings by
ordering trial by video-conferencing, and when the Hon'ble Supreme Court of
India in the subsequent case of Bharatiben Ravibhal Rav (supra), where the
matrimonial proceedings was transferred from Ahmedabad (Gujrat) to
Dungarpur (Rajasthan), there is no doubt that the Hon’ble Supreme Court of
India deemed it fit to exclude some cases from video-conferencing, where
the parties did not consent for such trial. Hence, this Court is of the view
that in cases, where the wife has reservations from trial on videoconferencing, it would be just and proper to transfer the proceedings from

one place to another, instead of compelling a trial by video-conferencing.

Page 13 of 32
17) This court has also taken note of the practical problems and
difficulties expressed by the learned counsels for the petitioners. To mention
a few, there is no provision under the Gauhati High Court Rules as well as
Civil Court Rules & Orders of the Gauhati High Court relating to trial by
video-conferencing. There are no provisions of sending petitions by e-mail
and for its acceptance by Courts. There is no provision to empower a trial
court to defer the proceedings merely because it receives communication
over phone call to Court Manager of by e-mail that pleadings or petitions had
been despatched by post. The subordinate Court staffs have not been
sensitized to promptly open postal envelopes and urgently tag the petitions
received by post in court record and to place them before the Court. The
Presiding Officers of the Courts are not yet sensitized to wait till such time in
the day till postal service is usually made to court premises, for which there
is every possibility that a court may pass orders in first half of the day and
the postal delivery containing petitions and pleadings being received after
orders are passed. There is no provisions in Gauhati High Court Rules as well
as Civil Court Rules & Orders of the Gauhati High Court about what would
happen if a party agreeing for trial by video-conference sends a pleading,
petition or document by post and the postal envelope is misplaced and what
would be the procedure for reconstruction of documents not received by
court, but lost in postal transit. There are no provisions in the Gauhati High
Court Rules as well as Civil Court Rules & Orders of the Gauhati High Court
to make a Court Manager as an agent for the out-station litigant, so as to
enable the Courts to accept submissions made by a Court Manager on the
basis of telephonic message or e-mail received from a litigant, and to pass
orders on the basis of any submissions made before the Court. The
procedure of regular trial by Video-conferencing, in the opinion of this court,
must be incorporated in the appropriate Rules governing trial like Gauhati
High Court Rules as well as Civil Court Rules & Orders of the Gauhati High
Court, because it is one thing to have an occasional session by Video
Conferencing like delivering judgment, one or two session of cross
Page 14 of 32
examination of accused who for various reasons like internal security, or to
maintain peace and tranquillity, is not desired to be moved from prison, or
video-conferencing with a hospitalized person, periodical viewing of undertrial accused lodged in jail by concerned Magistrates, etc., to name a few.
Therefore, it is hoped that in future, some of the issues are addressed by
this Court so that appropriate Rules are framed for facilitating video
conferencing, aS suggested by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India.

18) Moreover, in some cases, where there are pending litigations
between the parties in the place where the wife is residing as was the facts
In the case of Bharatiben Ravibhai (supra), where there was a pending
litigation at Dungarpur (Rajasthan), for which the matrimonial proceedings
was transferred or in one of the present case in hand, where the husband Is
a police personnel and the wife apprehends threat. This Court cannot shut

its eyes to such practical ground realities.

19) Moreover, it has come to the notice of this Court that the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India in the case of Santhini Vs. Vijaya Venketesh by an
order dated 09.08.2017 (Para-19), has referred the case of Krishna Veni
Nagam (supra) to the Hon’ble The Chief J ustice of India to consider referring
the said case before a larger Bench. The outcome of such reference is not

known. The relevant para of the said order is quoted below:
‘19. To what extent the confidence and confidentiality will be
safeguarded and protected in video conferencing, particularly when
efforts are taken by the counsellors, welfare experts, and for that
matter, the court itself for reconciliation, restitution of conjugal rights
or alssolution of marriage, ascertainment of the wishes of the child in
custody matters, etc, Is a serious issue to be considered. /t Is
certainly difficult in video conferencing, if not impossible, to maintain
confidentiality. It has also to be noted that the footage in video
conterenang becomes part of the record whereas the reconciiatory
efforts taken by the duty-holders referred to above are not meant to
be part of the record. All that aoart, in reconciiatory efforts, physical
presence of the parties would make a significant difference. Having
regard to the very object behind the establishment of Family Courts
Act, 1984, to Order XXXIIA of the Code of Civil Procedure and to the

Page 15 of 32
soedal provisions introduced in the Hindu Marriage Act under
Sections 22, 23 and 26, we are of the view that the airections Issued
by this Court in Krishna Veni Nagam (supra) need reconsideration on
the aspect of video conferencing in matrimonial disputes. ”

20) Therefore, in the overall view of the matter, as the case of Krishna
Veni Nagam (supra) does not lay down a law prohibiting transfer of any case
and instead follow the course of trial by video-conferencing, this court is of
the view that until some provisions are made in the Gauhati High Court Rules
as well as Civil Court Rules & Orders of the Gauhati High Court in respect of
full trial by video-conferencing, it would not be in the interest of the litigants
of the State of Assam to mandatorily undertake a full length trial by videoconferencing as an alternative of transfer of suits. The provisions of Section
24 CPC having not been struck-off, the power of this Court to exercise
jurisdiction under Section 24 CPC to transfer suits and proceedings cannot be
taken away in appropriate cases. In light of the various orders passed by the
Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in the various cases referred herein before,
with greatest respect to the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India, as the case of
Krishna Vent Nagam (supra) is under reconsideration of the said Hon'ble
Court and as even in the said judgment, the matrimonial case was indeed
transferred from Jabalpur to Hyderabad, in the absence of law laid down
curtailing the power of this Court to exercise jurisdiction under Section 24
CPC, this court is inclined to continue to exercise jurisdiction under Section
24 CPC.

21) With the aforesaid observations, the individual cases are now taken

up:
. IPPC) No. 14/2017 - Smt. Subarna Bhattacharjee Vs. Sri

Siddartha Biswas - \n this case, the petitioner- wife is seeking
transfer of proceedings of F.C.(C) Case No. 77/2017 from the Court
of Principal J udge, Family Court, Kamrup (M), Guwahati to the Court
of Principal Judge, Family Court, Silchar. She is a Doctor and
associated with works of National Rural Health Mission. She has a

Page 16 of 32
minor baby. Petitioner has no brother, but lives with aged parents.
She claims that marriage was solemnized at Silchar and after
marriage, she was living in their matrimonial home and Kolkata and
the case was filed at Guwahati to harass her and the Court at
Guwahati had no jurisdiction. In the affidavit in opposition, the
respondent has not denied that after marriage at Silchar, their
matrimonial home was not at Kolkata. Therefore, this court deems it
fit to transfer the proceedings of F.C.(C) Case No. 77/2017 from the
Court of Principal J udge, Family Court, Kamrup (M), Guwahati to the
Court of Principal J udge, Family Court, Silchar. The learned Court of
Principal J udge, Family Court, Kamrup (M), Guwahati shall transfer
the records of F.C.(C) Case No. 77/2017 to the Court of Principal
Judge, Family Court, Silchar. In this regard, it would be the duty of
the petitioner to produce a certified copy of this order before the
Court of Principal Judge, Family Court, Kamrup (M), Guwahati for
transfer of the said proceedings.

The parties, who are represented by their counsel, shall appear
before the Court of Principal J udge, Family Court, Cachar, Silchar, on
03.11.2017 without any further notice for appearance and by
producing certified copy of this order, shall seek further instruction

from the said learned Court.

7r.P.(C) No. 11/2017 - Maya Das (Thapa) Vs. Dipankar Das 
In this case, the petitioner/wife is the defendant in FC (Civil) Case
No.309/16 pending before the learned Principal J udge, Family Court,
Silchar, Cachar, which is a petition under Section 9 of the Hindu
Marriage Act, 1955. The petitioner has prayed for transfer of the
case from the Court of learned Principal J udge, Family Court, Cachar,
Silchar to the court of learned Principal Judge, Family Court at
Dimapur, Nagaland. In this case, this Court finds that this is a case
for the transfer from one State to another. In this regard, this Court

in the case of Porm Sengupta vs. Biswaj/it Senguota, (2015) 6 GLR

Page 17 of 32
396; (2016) 1 GLT 627, had discussed the jurisdiction of the Court
under Section 24 CPC and had laid down that this Court does not
have jurisdiction to make inter-State transfer of the suites and
proceedings. Therefore, such transfer, in the considered opinion of
this Court can only be made under Section 25 CPC. Therefore, by
following the precedent of the case of Porn’ Sengupta (supra), this
Court is not inclined to transfer the suit to outside the State although
Subordinate courts in the State of Nagaland are within the
jurisdiction of this Court, but still, it lies outside the State of Assam.
The parties, who are represented by their counsel, shall appear
before the Court of Principal J udge, Family Court, Cachar, Silchar, on
03.11.2017 without any further notice for appearance and by
producing certified copy of this order, shall seek further instruction

from the said learned Court.

7r.P.(C) No. 80/2016 - Mrs. Queen Hazarika Gogol Vs. Sri
Uttam Gogol - \n this case, the petitioner/wife is the defendant in

Misc. Case (G) No.1/15 pending before the court of learned District
Judge, Dibrugarh, which is a petition under Section 10 of the
Guardians and Wards Act, 1890. The petitioner has prayed for
transfer of the case from the court of learned District Judge,
Dibrugarh to the court of learned District Judge, Sivasagar. The
respondent/husband herein is reported to be a police personnel
serving aS a constable and the minor child (aged 4 years and 5
months, aS no 16.02.2015, the date of filing of the guardianship
petition) is now residing with the petitioner/wife. Moreover, the
petitioner has claimed that she has become entitled to receive
maintenance from the husband as per the order passed by the
learned Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Nazira in Misc. Case
No.2/2014 filed under Section 125 Cr.P.C. (at one place also
mentioned as order passed by the learned Munsiff-cuny] udicial

Magistrate, First Class, Nazira). It appears that the respondent had

Page 18 of 32
also instituted Criminal Revision No.8(1)/2015 before the learned
Sessions J udge, Sivasagar. Therefore, in this case, this Court finds
that the ratio of the case Bharatiben Ravibhai Rav (supra) is found to
be applicable. Therefore, the proceedings of the Misc. Case (G)
No.1/15 under Section 10 of the Guardians and Wards Act pending
in the court of learned District J udge, Dibrugarh is transferred to the
learned District J udge, Sivasagar, who will have power to delegate it
to another appropriate and competent court.

The learned Court of District Judge, Dibrugarh shall transfer
the records of Misc. Case (G) No.1/15 to the learned Court of District
Judge, Sivasagar. In this regard, it would be the duty of the
petitioner to produce a certified copy of this order before the learned
Court of District Judge, Dibrugarh for transfer of the said
proceedings.

The parties, who are represented by their learned counsels are
directed to appear in person or through duly instructed pleader
before the court of the learned District Judge, Dibrguarh on
03.11.2017 and by producing a certified copy of this order, shall

seek further instruction from the said learned court.

Tr.P.(C) No. 77/2016 - Kabita Baid Vs. Dharamchand Baid The petitioner/ wife is the defendant in T.S.(D) No. 17/2016,

pending before the learned Court of District Judge, Bongaigaon,
which is a petition under Section 13(1)(i-a) and (i-b) of Hindu
Marriage Act, 1955, seeking dissolution of marriage by divorce and
other reliefs. The petitioner has prayed for transfer of the said case
from the learned Court of District Judge, Bongaigaon to the learned
Court of Principal J udge, Family Court, Kamrup (M), Guwahati. It Is
stated that the petitioner has shifted her residence from Kokrajhar to
Guwahati for better treatment as she is suffering from “Prolapse
Intervertebral Disc”. She also had to shift her place of residence

from her parental home because her status as a lady living

Page 19 of 32
V.

separately from husband without any children is causing stigma to
the family, which is hindering the marriage of her sister. The
respondent has contested the case by filing Affidavit- in- opposition,
Stating that the petitioner is contesting Misc. Case No. 42/2016,
which is an application under section 125 Cr.P.C. at Bongaigaon. It is
also stated that the respondent is an orthopedically challenged
person who cannot move without an escort and for the said purpose,
the respondent has relied on a concession certificate annexed to his
affidavit- in- opposition. Therefore, considering the un-denied
statement that the petitioner is contesting Misc. Case No. 42/2016,
under section 125 Cr.P.C. at Bongaigaon and that the respondent is
an orthopedically challenged person, and on further considering the
fact that the respondent has sought for transfer only because she
has changed her residence, this Court is of the view that this is not a
fit case for the transfer of the proceedings of T.S.(D) No. 17/2016,
pending before the learned Court of District J udge, Bongaigaon. In
this case, this Court finds that the ratio of the case Bharatiben
Ravibhal Rav (supra) \s found to be applicable as the petitioner is
pursuing Misc. Case No. 46/2016 under Section 125 Cr.P.C. at
Bongaigaon. Hence, this application stands dismissed.

The parties, who are represented by their learned counsels are
directed to appear in person or through duly instructed pleader
before the court of the Court of the learned District Judge,
Bongaigaon on 03.11.2017 and by producing a certified copy of

this order, shall seek further instruction from the said learned court.

7r.P.(C) No. 25/2016 - Sri Sumit Ranjan Nath Vs. Smt.

Suchita Nath - The petitioner- husband is seeking transfer of the
proceedings of TS 93/2013 from the learned Court of District J udge,
Karimganj to the Court of Principal J udge, Family Court, Kamrup (M),
Guwahati. It is projected that TS 96/2013 between the parties was
compromised and disposed of by order dated 09.06.2014 passed by

Page 20 of 32
Vi.

the learned District J udge, Karimganj, by which the parties agreed to
live a conjugal life. But the same did not last. Thereafter, a decree of
divorce was validly passed by the learned Court of Principal J udge,
Family Court, Guwahati by order dated 08.09.2015 in F.C.(Civil) Case
No. 148/15. However, despite the decree, the respondent- wife has
filed Title (Restitution) Suit No. 14/2016 under section 9 of the Hindu
Marriage Act, 1955 before the learned Court of District J udge,
Karimganj, again seeking restitution of conjugal rights. The
petitioner is a personnel of Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB). The
respondent- wife has contested this application by filing Affidavit- inOpposition, claiming that the decree of divorce was obtained by
fraud. On perusal of the petition for divorce, being F.C.(C) 148/2015
as well as the agreement dated 29.06.2015 for divorce, both filed by
the respondent and copy of order dated 08.09.2015 passed in
F.C.(C) Case No. 148/2015 that the respondent has not been paid
any alimony or maintenance. The petitioner being a member of
Sashastra Seema Bal, can undertake the journey to Karimganj, but it
would be extremely difficult for the respondent to travel from
Karimganj to Guwahati. Therefore, this court finds that this is not a
fit case for transfer of the proceeding.

However, considering the submissions made by the learned
counsel for the petitioner that there is a decree of divorce operating,
the petitioner is permitted to move the learned Court of District
Judge, Karimganj with an appropriate application for considering the
maintainability of the Title (Restitution) Suit No. 14/2016. Till the
decision thereon, the petitioner shall also be at liberty to move the
said learned court for exemption from any personal appearance.

With the aforesaid observation, this application stands dismissed.

Case No. 3262/16 - State Vs. Manoj Saikia, and is pending before
the learned Court of Chief J udicial Magistrate, Tezour. No one has

IS a police personnel and the petitioner apprehends threat, and
moreover, aS GR Case No. 3262/16 is stated to be pending before
the learned Court of Chief J udicial Magistrate, Tezpur, this court is of

72/2016, pending before the learned Court of District J udge, Nagaon
stands transferred to the learned Court of District Judge, Sonitpur,

Page 27 of 32
XIl.

13(1) (iil) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 for dissolution of marriage
on the ground of serious mental disorder of the petitioner. The

doubt that the petitioner will face more difficulty in defending the

proceedings of T.S. (M) No. 28/2017 from the learned Court of
District Judge, Sonitpur, Tezpur to the learned Court of Principal

| UDGMENT AND ORDER
(Ajit Singh, CJ.)

This intra court appeal is directed against the order dated
29.9.2017 passed by the learned Single J udge of this High Court whereby
he has allowed WP(C) 4374/2015 of Respondent No.4 - Gopal Das.

2. The short point which calls for our consideration is whether the
Indian Oil Corporation (in short “IOC”’) was justified in giving an
opportunity to the appellant to offer an alternative plot of land after it was
found that the plot of land offered by him in the application for showroom
was not located in the advertised location or locality. Another question
which requires consideration is whether the land offered in the application
was located in the advertised location or locality. The learned Single
Judge by the impugned order has already held that the approach of |OC
asking for an alternative plot of land from the appellant was wholly
misconceived and quashed his selection for distributorship of Liquefied
Petroleum Gas (LPG). But since the aggrieved appellant has filed this
appeal, we shall re-examine the issue. There is however no adjudication
by the learned Single J udge on the issue whether the land offered in the

application by him was situated in the advertised location or locality.

3. On 30.9.2013, |OC issued an advertisement inviting applications for
selection of LPG distributorship at Karimganj Town under “urban” market
type category. The last date for submission of application was
31.10.2013. According to the advertisement, a showroom of minimum
dimension of 3ms X 4.5ms, as per the standard layout, had to be made in
a shop/land located in the advertised location or locality and it should be
easily accessible to general public through a suitable approach road. Also
for the purposes of godown, the advertisement stated that the applicants
should own a plot of land of minimum dimension of 25ms X 30ms (within
15 Kilometers from municipal/ town/ village limits of the location offered
in the same State). Clause 4 of the advertisement further disclosed that

detailed guidelines on eligibility, infrastructure requirements of land for

Page 2 of 7
LPG godown, showroom, infrastructure for Home delivery of cylinders etc.
along with the details of selection process were given in the Brochure,
which could be collected personally or be downloaded from the website.
This means that the |OC can make selection of distributorship only in a
manner provided in the Brochure which is therefore also named as
Brochure on Guidelines for Selection of Regular LPG Distributors, May,
2013 (for short, “Brochure of May, 2013”).

A. Clause 6.1 (vill) of the Brochure of May, 2013 provides that the
applicant should own a suitable shop of minimum size 3ms x 4.5ms in
dimension or a plot of land for construction of showroom of minimum size
3ms x 4.5ms as on the last date for submission of application as specified
in the advertisement or corrigendum (if any) at the advertised location or
locality mentioned in the advertisement. This Clause also says that the
shop/plot of land should be easily accessible to general public through a
Suitable approach road and that if the applicant was having more than
one shop or a plot of land for construction of showroom as on the last
date for submission of application at the advertised location or locality,

the details of the same can be provided in the application.

5. One another Brochure on Guidelines for Selection of Regular LPG
Distributors was introduced in August, 2013. However, Clause 6.1 (viii) of
both the Brochures are same and they clearly provide that applicant
should own a suitable shop or a plot of land at the advertised location or
locality mentioned in the advertisement and if the candidate had more
than one shop or plot of land at the advertised location of locality, he may

give the details of same in the application.

6. The IOC shortlisted three applicants including appellant and
respondent No.4 for selection of LPG Distributorship. The selection was
made by ‘draw of lots’ in which appellant was selected. Aggrieved with
the selection of appellant, Respondent No.4 made a complaint to the |OC
stating that the land offered by him for showroom did not fall in the

Karimganj Town. On enquiry, the |OC also found that the land offered by

Page 3 of 7
the appellant in fact did not fall at the advertised location or locality and
yet by communication dated 14.7.2015 rejected the complaint on the
ground that on an opportunity given to him another suitable land was
offered which was accepted. This decision of the |OC was based on Policy
Manual for Regular Distributorship May, 2013 which says that In case the
land mentioned in the application by the applicant for godown/showroom
is not found to be suitable and if the applicant had any alternate land as
per norms with the deed of registration on or before the last date for
Submission of application as specified in the advertisement or

corrigendum (if any), the same can be considered.

7. Respondent No.4 finally challenged the decision of |1OC by filing
WP(C) 4374/2015 on the ground that it had no authority for giving an
opportunity to the appellant to offer another land/plot for distributorship
once it was found that the land offered in the application for showroom
was not situated in the advertised location or locality. Respondent No.4
also. averred that Policy Manual for Selection of Regular LPG
Distributorship May, 2013 was restricted to the internal use of the
Company and the same could not have been resorted to, as the selection
could be made only in accordance with the manner provided in the
Brochures which held the field on the date of advertisement or till the last
date for making application. In reply, the 1OC defended its decision of
giving an opportunity to the appellant for offering another land/plot
despite the fact that land offered by him in the application was not found
to be situated in the advertised location or locality. The appellant adopted
the stand taken by the IOC and even took the plea that the land offered

in the application was situated in the advertised location or locality.

8. The learned Single Judge after carefully examining the process of
selection for LPG Distributorship as provided in the Brochures which were
holding the field till the last date of making application has quashed
decision of the |OC asking for an alternate plot of land from the appellant
on the ground that it was wholly misconceived. According to the learned

Single J udge the IOC could have asked for an alternate plot of land from

Page 4 of 7
the appellant only if the land offered in his application was in the
advertised location or locality and was not found to be suitable. On these
findings, the learned single judge has also quashed the selection of
appellant for the distributorship in question. As already mentioned above,
the learned Single J udge did not advert on the issue whether the land
offered in the application was situated in the advertised location or
locality. The appellant has therefore filed the present appeal, whereas the
IOC is satisfied with the findings of the learned Single Judge that its
decision to ask for alternate land from the appellant was absolutely
misconceived. Had the |OC not been satisfied, it too would have filed an

appeal challenging the findings of the learned Single J udge.

9. In Dutta Associates Pvt. Ltd’ vs. !ndo Merchantiles Pvt. Ltd} (1997)
1 SCC 53, the Supreme Court has held that whatever procedure is
proposed to be followed in accepting the tender must be clearly stated in
the tender notice and the consideration of the tenders received and the
procedure to be followed in the matter of acceptance of a tender should
be transparent, fair and open. Therefore, the |OC could follow only that
procedure in the selection of LPG distributorship which was stated in the
advertisement. But the procedure followed by it in selecting the appellant
was not stated in the advertisement. The learned Single Judge has

therefore rightly quashed his selection.

10. As noticed above, the advertisement stated that selection for the
distributorship shall be made in accordance with the procedure prescribed
in the Brochures. The Brochures which admittedly held the field on the
last date of making application for distributorship were of May, 2013 and
August,2013. Both these Brochures provided that in case the applicant
had more than one plot of land at the advertised location or locality for
construction of showroom as on the late date of application as specified in
the advertisement, the details of the same may also be stated in the
application. The appellant in his application mentioned about only one
plot. The Brochures did not contain any provision authorising the |OC to

ask for another plot after the plot mentioned in the application was not

Page 5 of 7
found to be situated in the advertised location or locality. And on a
complaint made by respondent No.4, the |OC found that the plot offered
by the appellant in the application was not situated in the advertised
location i.e. Karimganj Town. This finding of |OC also had the support of
letter dated 9.10.2014 of the Karimganj Municipal Board as well as letter
dated 16.9.2014 of Sarifnagar Gaon Panchayat. Both these letters confirm
that the land offered in the application was not situated in the municipal
area of Karimganj. The |OC, therefore, in all fairness, in the absence of
any other plot offered in the application ought to have rejected the
candidature of the appellant. But, instead, it relying upon the Policy
Manual for Selection of Regular LPG Distributorship May, 2013, which was
nowhere mentioned in the advertisement, gave the option to the
appellant to offer another plot which is not permissible. Interestingly, the
appellant was also informed by IOC vide letter dated 17.10.2014 that
after investigation the plot of land offered by him was not found to be in
the advertised location and he did not challenge that finding before any
forum. In reply, he merely stated that the land offered was situated in the
advertised location and offered another land in the Karimganj Town. Since
the appellant did not challenge the finding of |OC before any forum, the
learned Single J udge was of the view that no adjudication was called for

in that regard.

11. Pursuant to our direction, the Additional Senior Government
Advocate, Assam has produced certificates dated 16.9.2017 and
15.9.2017 of the Deputy Director, Town and Country Planning, Karimganj
and Director, Municipal Administration Department respectively. In both
these certificates the authorities have stated in one voice that the land
offered by the appellant on the date of application was not situated in
Karimganj Town. According to these certificates, the land offered was in
rural area, which is outside Karimganj Municipal Board. We, therefore,
have no hesitation in agreeing with the findings of the |OC that the land
offered by the appellant was not situated in the advertised location or

locality as the selection of LPG distributorship was under “urban” market

Page 6 of 7
type category i.e. Karimganj Town. Also under the provisions of Policy
Manual for Selection of Regular LPG Distributorship May, 2013, the |OC
could have asked for an alternate plot of land from the appellant only if
the plot of land offered in the application was not found to be suitable for
showroom provided the same was situated in the advertised location or
locality. But, as already seen above, the plot of land offered by the
appellant in the application was found to be outside the advertised
location and therefore, suitability or non-suitability had no relevance to

ask for an offer of alternate plot of land.

12. For these reasons, we find no merit in the appeal. It is accordingly

dismissed.

|] UDGMENT & ORDER
(Manojsit Bhuyan, J)
1. The present appeal is directed against the common J udgment

& Order dated 25.04.2017 passed in a bunch of writ petitions where
the appellant was the petitioner in one of the writ petitions i.e. WP(C)
3218/2011. Prayer is made for giving him an opportunity to place his
case before the learned Single Judge as his case is distinct and
different from the rest of the writ petitions. Although the J udgment &
Order dated 25.04.2017 records consent of the petitioners to the
proposal made by the Advocate General, Assam for disposal of
individual cases by a High Powered Committee by passing individual
Speaking orders, Mr. Islam submits that no consent has been given on
behalf of the petitioner. To this end, he makes reference to the

ground taken in the appeal memo which reads as under:

Page 1of4
“2. For that the appellant humbly states that the points
raised before the court in his writ petition have not been
addressed nor considered on merit and on a wrong and
forcible assumption disposed of the writ petition on the
alleged consent given by the counsel of the petitioner.”

2. The facts on which the case of the appellant are stated to be
distinct and different, it is submitted that the appointment of the
appellant has nothing to do with the Advertisement dated 03.09.1991
or for that matter the Select List dated 04.01.1995. The appellant’s
case falls into a different category, inasmuch as, he was appointed as
Assistant Teacher in Graduate scale on 26.05.1994 against a post
created on 16.11.1991. Mr. Islam submits that this fact was taken
note of in Writ Appeal 529/1997, arising out of order passed in Civil
Rule No. 5216/1996 whereby a learned Single Judge had ordered
cancellation of appointments of those beyond the Select List dated
04.01.1995 and those not entitled to on the basis of their merit
position in the said Select List. As the order passed in Civil Rule No.
5216/1996 had the consequence of affecting the appellant's
appointment and since he was not impleaded as a party respondent in
the said Civil Rule, the Writ Appeal 529/1997 was instituted, which
was disposed of by a Division Bench of this Court on 12.05.2000
together with a bunch of writ appeals. In the said judgment of the
Division Bench, a finding was recorded that vacancies coming into
existence after issuance of the Advertisement dated 03.09.1991, that
is, IN respect of the posts sanctioned or created or upgraded after the
date of the advertisement, such vacancies would not be covered by
the Advertisement dated 03.09.1991 as those are clearly future
vacancies and not existing or anticipated vacancies. In the said
Division Bench judgement it was also held that the posts occurring
after the date of Advertisement dated 03.09.1991, being future
vacancies, would not be affected by the judgment in Civil Rule No.
5216/1996. Having held thus, the Division Bench observed that facts

Page 2 of 4
stated would require verification and if such facts are found to be
correct, then appropriate orders have to be passed by the authorities
in individual cases regarding the notices of cancellation of
appointments served on the appellants, which would mean the

appellants whose cases were similar to the present appellant.

3. According to Mr. Islam, in terms of the directions of the
Division Bench he was made to appear before the Commissioner &
Secretary to the Govt. of Assam, Education (Secondary) Department
vide notice dated 26.04.2011. According to him, he made an effective
reply to the Show Cause letter. However, by Order dated 27.05.2011,
the Commissioner & Secretary, held that the appellant cannot be
treated as a legal appointee and in that regard instructed the Director
of Secondary Education, Assam as well the Inspector of Schools,
Nalbari to complete the process of terminating the services in
pursuance of the order passed in Civil Rule 5216/1996 and other
connected Civil Rules. Aggrieved, the appellant filed WP(C)
3218/2011. Other writ petitions were also filed, which were heard
together and disposed of by the aforesaid common J udgment & Order
dated 25.04.2017.

4. On the facts above, Mr. Islam submits that the appellant could
not have been relegated to the forum of a High Powered Committee.
Instead, on the very fact that the order of the Commissioner &
Secretary was not in terms of the findings recorded in the Division
Bench judgment, the said impugned order ought to have been
interfered with holding it as illegal and non est in law. On these
counts, a limited prayer is made for setting aside the common
Judgment & Order dated 25.04.2017 in so far as the appellant is
concerned and for fresh hearing of WP(C) 3218/2011.

Page 3 of 4
5. Having given our anxious consideration on the facts stated in
the appeal and the limited prayer so made, we find that the order of
the Commissioner & Secretary to the Govt. of Assam, Education
(Secondary) Department dated 27.05.2011 is required to be tested in
the light of the findings of the Division Bench in WA 529/1997 and
other connected writ appeals, which were heard and disposed of by
the Division Bench on 12.05.2000. We refrain from entering into the
merits of the case, leaving it open to the appellant to place his case
afresh before the learned Single J udge on the legality and validity of
the impugned Order dated 27.05.2011.

6. WP(C) 3218/2011 stands restored to file for fresh hearing on
merits. We hope and expect that WP(C) 3218/2011 is heard at the
earliest convenience, being mindful of the fact that the appellant has
just about 1 year to go on retirement on attaining the age of
Superannuation. The present appeal stands disposed of accordingly.
The directions made by the learned Single J udge for consideration of
individual cases by a High Powered Committee shall not apply to the
appellant until final disposal of WP(C) 3218/2011. Needless to say,
the fate of the appellant shall follow the decision on merits of the said
WP(C) 3218/2011.

Ms. ML Gope, Ms. N Hawelia and Ms. N Gogoi, learned counsel
for respondent Nos. 1 and 2.

Heard on admission.

These three appeals have been filed by the State Government
against an interim order dated 16.08.2017 passed by the learned Single
Judge of this High Court in WP(C) Nos. 4785/2017, 4787/2017 and
4789/2017, whereby he has directed release of the seized bags of areca
nuts after due verification in favour of respondent Nos. 1 and 2 on

certain terms and conditions.

Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 in all the three appeals are registered
under the Goods and Service Tax Act, 2017. Earlier they were registered
under the Assam Value Added Tax Act. They carry on the business of
dried areca nuts. On 27.07.2017, the authorities of Bureau of
Investigation for Economic Offences seized 7290 bags of dried areca
nuts from their godown. The authorities are reported to have made the
seizure in exercise of powers conferred under Section 102 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure on suspicion that the areca nuts stored were of
Burmese origin and were smuggled through Mizoram border for onward
transportation to other parts of the country. Aggrieved with the search
of their godowns and seizure of the dried areca nuts, respondent Nos. 1
and 2 have filed WP(C) Nos. 4785/2017, 4787/2017 and 4789/2017 on
the ground that the entire action of the authorities is illegal and without
jurisdiction. In the writ petitions, Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 also prayed
for an interim relief directing the authorities to release the seized bags

of areca nuts in their favour. The learned Single Judge after hearing the
Page 1of2
respective counsel for the parties, found that the seized bags of areca
nuts were neither stolen nor were kept in suspicious circumstances and
at best, respondent Nos. 1 and 2 were liable to pay tax which would be
in the domain of Finance and Taxation Department. The learned Single
Judge, therefore, to facilitate respondent Nos. 1 and 2 to carry on the
legitimate business and taking note of the fact that rate of tax is 2.5%
for areca nuts under the Assam Goods and Service Tax Act, 2017, by the
impugned order has directed the authorities to release the seized 7290
bags of areca nuts in favour of respondent Nos. 1 and 2 on their
furnishing bank guarantee of Rs. 30 Lacs towards estimated tax to the
Commissioner of State Tax after due verification in the presence of Tax
Department officials. It is in this background, the State has filed the

present appeals.

As seen above, the authorities had seized the bags of areca nuts
on 27.07.2017 and although more than 1 month has passed, till this
date, no offence has been registered against respondent Nos. 1 and 2.
Not only this, the learned senior Additional Advocate General, Assam
candidly admitted that the authorities are still not sure which offence is
made out against respondent Nos. 1 and 2. This being the situation, we
find no good ground to interfere with the impugned order. The
authorities may, however, prepare a Panchnama of the seized bags of
areca nuts before they are released and may even retain some of the

areca nuts for the purposes of sample, if required.

The appeals are accordingly dismissed summarily.

has prepared the roster list wherein the names of the private respondents

appeared above the General category officers who are otherwise senior to

reservation in promotion, it has to collect the quantifiable data showing

compliance with Article 335 of the Constitution of India. From the post of Superintendent of Taxes, the respondent
No.6 was promoted to the rank of Assistant Commissioner of Taxes on

upon not receiving objections, the provisional gradation list was finalised
and published vide Notification dated 10.05.2011 (Annexure-E) wherein,
the names of most of the private respondents were shown above the 1992

batch of Assistant Commissioners except the respondent No. 7.

Clause (xi) and Section 5A of the Amendment Act of 2012, the
Department of Finance vide Notification 08.03.2013 (Annexure-}) and
Notification dated 13.03.2013 (Annexure-K) published post-based roster
showing various position in the post of Deputy Commissioner and
Assistant Commissioner of Taxes respectively. According to the petitioners,
from the Notification issued on 13.03.2013, it is clear that in the cadre of
Assistant Commissioner of Taxes, there are 25 posts and the Department
has prepared the roster list wherein the names of the private respondents

appeared above the General category officers who are otherwise senior to

WP (C) No. 452 of 2014 Page 4 of 11
the private respondents. The private respondents are mostly 1993 batch
appointees except for respondent No.6 who is of 1997 batch and
therefore, he is junior to the petitioners. The petitioners thus being

aggrieved are before this Court through the instant writ petition.

7. The prayer of the petitioners was initially for quashing the
promotion orders of the private respondents dated 01.01.2009,
15.11.2010 and 05.05.2010. However, Mr. MK Choudhury, the learned
senior counsel for the writ petitioners submit that the petitioners do not
wish to press the said prayer and instead confine their prayer in directing
the State respondents to fix the seniority of the petitioners in the
gradation list of Assistant Commissioner of Taxes for promotion to the
post of Deputy Commissioner of Taxes and to conduct the selection
process for promotion by yearwise vacancy without clubbing together the
vacancies in one year.

3. Mr. MK Choudhury further submits that it has been held in the
case Of M Nagral & Ors. (Supra) as well as Uttar Pradesh Power
Corporation Ltd. (Supra) that if the State Government wants to apply
reservation in promotion, it has to collect the quantifiable data showing
the backwardness of class and inadequacy of representation in addition to
compliance with Article 335 of the Constitution of India. The State
respondents without acquiring the quantifiable data have simply come up
with the Amendment Act of 2012 which under the given facts and
circumstances Is only illegal and impermissible and therefore, Court should
Suitably interfere by directing the State respondents to appropriately fix
the seniority of the petitioners in the gradation list of Assistant

Commissioner of Taxes.

WP (C) No. 452 of 2014 Page 5 of 11
8. In response to the writ petition, the respondent No.4 t.e. the
Secretary to the Government of Assam, Legislative Department has filed
an affidavit-in-opposition on 31.03.2014 wherein it has been contended
that the Amendment Act of 2012 has been made as per the enabling
provision of Article 16(4), 16(4-A) and 16(4-B) of the Constitution of India.
The State Government in fact has duly considered the criteria of
backwardness, inadequacy of representation and relevant datas in
preparing the Assam Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Reservation
of Vacancies in Services and Posts) Act, 1978. In fact, the Amendment Act
of 2012 has been enacted pursuant to the decision of the Apex Court in
the case of R.K Sabharwal & Ors. Vs. State of Punjab & Ors. (1995)2 SCC
745. The amendment is only in compliance to the interpretation made by
the Apex Court for making vacancy based reservation as post based

reservation. Therefore, the Amendment Act of 2012 was fully justified.

9. With regard to acquiring quantifiable data for inadequacy of
representation of SC and ST communities in public services, backwardness
of the community and efficiency in administration, no fresh exercise was
required as no change in ratio of percentage of reservation is made by the
new Act but every establishment before implementing the Act are required
to make an exercise of the quantum of representation of SC and ST
communities and to what extent it has been implementing the reservation
policy and what still remains before preparing the post-based roster
register and make entry into the list whenever any change occur due to
recruitment and promotion and the procedural guidelines are included in
Section 5A (ii) to (xii) of the amending Act. Thus, it is contended that the
Act was prepared within the purview of Article- 16(4), 16(4-B) read with
Article 335 and Article 46 of the Constitution of India.

WP (C) No. 452 of 2014 Page 6 of 11
10. The private respondent Nos.5, 6, 7 and 8 have also filed their
affidavit-in-opposition wherein it has been contended that except for the
respondent No.6 they too were appointed as Superintendent of Taxes by
the same notification dated 13.08.1993 in which the petitioners were
appointed. As for the respondent No.6, he was appointed on 03.02.1997.
The respondent Nos.9 and 10 were appointed much earlier to all the

private respondents |.e. on 25.05.1992.

11. From the post of Superintendent of Taxes, the respondent
No.6 was promoted to the rank of Assistant Commissioner of Taxes on
01.01.2009, the respondent No.7 on 15.11.2010 and the respondent No.8
on 05.05.2011 whereas the Amendment Act of 2012 only came into force
w.e.f. 27.05.2013. In terms of the non-obstante clause contained in
Section 14, all the actions taken under the Act prior to amendment are
deemed to be validly done under the corresponding provisions of the
Amendment Act of 2012. Furthermore, the private respondents have
cleared the training and departmental examination much earlier to the
petitioners and as such they were confirmed in service and considered for
promotion much earlier. The private respondents have also contended
that the provisional gradation list of Assistant Commissioner of Taxes was
published vide notification dated 17.03.2011 inviting objections to be
Submitted within a period of 15 days. However, as no objection was filed,
the same was finalized vide notification dated 10.05.2011. Therefore the
attempt of the petitioners to raise objections against the gradation list at

this stage Is only hit by delay and estoppel.

WP (C) No. 452 of 2014 Page 7 of 11
12. The private respondents have also contended that in compliance
with the decision of the Apex Court in the case of M/ Nagraj & Ors. (Supra)
as well as U.P Power Corporation Ltd. (supra), the State Government had
constituted a one-man commission appointing Sri Harish Sonowal. |AS
retired who studied and acquired the ‘quantifiable data’ with regard to
backwardness of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and their
inadequacy in representation in Government services. On 08.12.2014, the
respondent No.3 issued a circular informing all the Departments that the
report of the one-man commission has been accepted by the State
Government. As a result, office memorandum dated 29.12.2014 was
issued wherein guidelines have been prescribed for implementation of the
post based roster reservation in matter of reservation of posts for
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in direct recruitment and
promotion. Clause-2 of the said office memorandum deals with the
operation of roster and Clause-2.7 therein enumerates that the post-based
roster shall operate on the principle of replacement and not as a running
account. Clause-3.1 to 3.4 on the other hand lays down the procedure to
be followed in the case of SC/ST candidates being appointed on merit. It
was thus contended that the petitioners cannot have any grievance

against the private respondents under the facts and circumstances.

13. Against the affidavit-in-opposition of the private respondent
Nos.5 to 8, the petitioners have filed their affidavit-in-reply contending
Inter alia that since the respondents concerned were only promoted on
officiating basis by invoking Regulation 4(d) of the Assam Public Service
Commission (Limitation of Functions) Regulation, 1951, the same did not
create any vested right upon them especially upon considering the

prescribed limitation of one year under the said provision. Non-following of

WP (C) No. 452 of 2014 Page 8 of 11
post based reservation policy in promotion as enunciated in AK
Sabharwal’s case (Supra) was also reiterated. The private respondent
Nos.5, 6, 7 & 8 have also filed an additional affidavit to bring on record

their respective confirmation order in the post of Superintendent of Taxes.

14. | have heard the learned counsels appearing for the rival
parties and | have also perused the materials available on record. The
question that is to be decided from the case projected by the petitioners is
whether the State respondents are justified in promoting the private
respondents before the petitioners ignoring their seniority in the lower
post of Superintendent of Taxes. Secondly, whether the gradation list of
Assistant Commissioner of Taxes finalized on 10.05.2011 is liable to be
refixed/redone and thirdly, whether vacancies in the post of Deputy

Commissioner of Taxes should be filled up by yearwise vacancy.

15. Neither the Finance (Taxation) Department nor the Personnel
(B) Department have filed their response in the matter except for the
Legislative Department i.e., respondent No.4 and the private respondent
Nos.5 to 8. It may also be noticed that the representation of the
petitioners dated 03.09.2013 (Annexure-H) has also not been considered

and disposed.

16. The private respondents in their affidavit-in-opposition have
stated that the State Government in compliance with the decision of the
Apex Court in the case of M Nagraj (Supra) as well as Uttar Pradesh Power
Corporation Ltd. (supra) had constituted one-man commission appointing
Harish Sonowal , Retd. |AS to study and acquire the quantifiable data with

regard to backwardness of Scheduled Case and Scheduled Tribes and their

WP (C) No. 452 of 2014 Page 9 of 11
inadequacy in representation in the Government services. The matter was
examined by this Court in the case of Equality Forum & anr. -vs- The
State of Assam & ors reported in 2016 (1) GLT 710, wherein it was held
that the exercise carried out by the one-man commission does not fulfill
the mandate laid down in the case of Nagraj(Supra) and thereby vitiating
the cabinet memorandum which was prepared upon acceptance of the
one-man commission report by the State Government. This Court held
that the backwardness of Schedule Caste and Schedule Tribes vis-a-vis
promotion would have to be determined cadre wise and based on the
quantifiable data which is a continuous process and cannot be a one-time
exercise. Hence, it was held that the one-man commission do not fulfill

the mandate laid down in Nagraj case.

17. Pursuant to the decision rendered in the case of Equality Forum
& ors.(Supra), the State Government in the Department of Welfare of the
Plains, Tribes and backward class have come up with an office
memorandum dated 3.8.2016 wherein the review of Government policy of
reservation in promotion with reference to High Court’s Judgments have
been contemplated. The same have been brought to the notice of this
Court although not formally by way of filing an affidavit. Therefore,
considering the fact that the representation of the petitioners dated
13.9.2013 (Annexure-H) filed before the Additional Chief Secretary to the
Government of Assam, Finance Department has not been considered and
disposed and taking into account the developments that has taken place
pursuant to the decision rendered in the case of Equality Forum(supra), |
am of the considered view that the grievance of the petitioner as set out

in their representation should be considered by the said authority.

WP (C) No. 452 of 2014 Page 10 of 11
18. In that view of the matter, the Additional Chief Secretary to
the Government of Assam, Finance Department is directed to consider the
representation of the petitioners and thereafter dispose of the same by a
Speaking order within a period of 2(two) months from the date of receipt
of a certified copy of this order. Until the disposal of the representation as

directed, the interim order passed in the case shall continue.

19, The writ petition stands disposed of.

of the Sonia Gandhi L.P. School (respondent No.6) is, however un-represented. Moreover, the
list prepared by the Sub-Divisional Level Advisory Board, North Lakhimpur, was not
approved by the DEE. The
consequential order was then issued on 5.2.2009 (Annexure-L), whereby the DI of
Schools, North Lakhimpur has directed the petitioner to not to attend the school and
the school Head Teacher was also instructed, to stop the teacher for discharging her

service. On the absence of clearance of the SLEC for the appointment, made during
the ban period, the learned counsel reads the judgment dated 10.3.2015, in the
WP(C) No.3408/2012 (Hem Chandra Borah & 32 others vs. State of Assam &
others), to argue that these are procedural defects and are curable and accordingly
It is submitted that ex-post facto approval to the appointment by the SLEC [Now
Staff Inspection Unit (SIU)] can be considered for the petitioner, as was done for
the 33 litigants, in the WP(C) No.3408/2012. |The departmental lawyer refers to the ongoing screening process undertaken
by the Education Department to identify the huge number of illegal appointment of
teachers in the State and contend that preliminary findings show that, only 136
teachers were lawfully appointed amongst around 12000 illegal appointments made
during 1991—2001. Accordingly, it is argued that the relief cannot be allowed to any
such appointee, until his/her appointment status is established to be bonafide, by
the screening process. The respondents further contend that the Expert Committee which met on
26.9.2008, in pursuant to the Court’s direction in the WP(C) No.1816/2006, had
verified that the petitioner was illegally appointed during the ban period, without the
necessary clearance of the SLEC and the list in which her name appeared, was
never approved by the DEE. It is therefore argued that the petitioner is disentitled

to claim legitimacy, for her appointment. The recruitment of teachers in L.P. Schools is governed by the Elementary
Education Rules. for vacancies of Elementary School
Teachers, Assam Legislative Assembly constituency-wise existing in the year in the SubDivision. The State Government may
revise the amount of application fee from time to time. If there is no
vacancy of teacher in the School falling in a Legislative Assembly Constituency no select
list shall be prepared. The Director shall authenticate and get the select list so prepared
published by affixing copy thereof in the Office Notice Board of the Director, Elementary
Education, Assam. Inspector of Schools, District Elementary Education Officer, Block
Elementary Education Officer and Deputy Inspector of Schools and in any other manner
as the Government may deed fit as and when they are received from different SubDivisions. The select lists containing the results shall be public documents and shall be
made available to a bona fide member of the public on application with such requisite
fees as may be determined by the Government from time to time. 1015/2009 4 of 7
Schools or the District Elementary Education Officer as the case may be, shall appoint
the selected candidates in order of merits only from this authenticated select lists. The validity of the lists shall not extent beyond one year from
the date of its publication.” As can be seen from the above Aules, constituency wise selection is
envisaged and the prepared list should then be submitted to the DEE. Let me now examine the legality of the DEE’s decision challenged in this
case. Therefore, | am of the considered opinion that the double appointment
cannot by itself be an acceptable justification to hold that the petitioner was illegally
appointed. In fact, it is
not even the case of the petitioner that the list In which her name appeared at Sl. No.64, was ever authenticated by the DEE or published, as per the requirement of

Elementary Education Rules. In the Court’s judgment in the WP(C) No.3408/2012 (Hem Chandra Borah &
52 others vs. State of Assam & others), the learned Judge observed that when
appointments are made during the enforcement of the model code of conduct and
there was absence of SLEC clearance, such defects are curable and ex-post facto
approval for the appointment can also be granted by the Staff Inspection Unit (SIU),
of the Finance Department. 1.9.2004 and the concerned
litigants in the WP(C) No.3408/2012, were then regularized in those supemumerary
posts, under the common order dated 31.12.2016, issued by the DEE, Assam. In my perception, the verdict in the WP(C) No.3408/2012 (Hem Chandra
Borah & 32 others vs. State of Assam & others), does not confer absolute legitimacy
to the appointments made from the list prepared on 5.3.2001, by the North
Lakhimpur Sub-Divisional Level Committee. The fresh consideration is ordered to be made by the
Commissioner & Secretary to the Department of Elementary Education and not by
the DEE. The ordered exercise should be carried out expeditiously and preferably
within four months from today.","

Writ Petition (C) No. 1015/2009 1 of 7
J UDGEMENT AND ORDER (ORAL)

Heard Mr. N. Borah, the learned counsel for the petitioner. The learned
standing counsel for the Department of Secondary Education, Mr. N. Sarma appears
for the respondent Nos.1—4. The respondent No.5 & 7 are represented by Mr. P.
Nayak, the learned standing counsel for the Finance Department. The Headmaster

of the Sonia Gandhi L.P. School (respondent No.6) is, however un-represented.

2. The petitioner was appointed on 31.3.2001 (Annexure-A), as a fixed pay
teacher by the DI of Schools, North Lakhimpur, in the Sonia Gandhi L.P. School. She
challenges the soeaking order dated 7.1.2009 (Annexure-K), whereby following the
Court’s direction dated 26.4.2006 (Annexure-H), in the WP(C) No.1816/2006, the
Director of Elementary Education (DEE), Assam, has considered and rejected the
Salary claim. The DEE has concluded that the petitioner's appointment (on
31.3.2001), was during the ban period and no clearance of the State Level
Empowered Committee (SLEC) was obtained, for the appointment. Moreover, the
list prepared by the Sub-Divisional Level Advisory Board, North Lakhimpur, was not
approved by the DEE. Thus, her appointment was declared to be illegal and on that
basis, direction was issued to discontinue the service of the illegal appointee. The
consequential order was then issued on 5.2.2009 (Annexure-L), whereby the DI of
Schools, North Lakhimpur has directed the petitioner to not to attend the school and
the school Head Teacher was also instructed, to stop the teacher for discharging her

service.

3.1. Assailing the legality of the two impugned orders, the learned counsel Mr. N.
Borah submits that the petitioner’s name appeared at SI. No.64 of the select list
dated 5.3.2001 and therefore, legal justification for appointment of the selected

candidate, is claimed by the petitioner’s lawyer.

3.2. On the absence of clearance of the SLEC for the appointment, made during
the ban period, the learned counsel reads the judgment dated 10.3.2015, in the
WP(C) No.3408/2012 (Hem Chandra Borah & 32 others vs. State of Assam &
others), to argue that these are procedural defects and are curable and accordingly
It is submitted that ex-post facto approval to the appointment by the SLEC [Now
Staff Inspection Unit (SIU)] can be considered for the petitioner, as was done for
the 33 litigants, in the WP(C) No.3408/2012.

Writ Petition (C) No. 1015/2009 2 of 7
3.3. Since as many as 33 supernumerary posts were created for the 33
petitioners, of the WP(C) No.3408/2012, the learned counsel Mr. N. Borah submits
that the petitioner should also be similarly adjusted in a supernumerary post, in

order to ensure parity of relief, for the similarly situated incumbents.

3.4. As regards the general direction issued on 30.5.2001, for cancellation of
appointment of those inducted during the ban period without following the due
process, the counsel refers to the order dated 27.11.2003, in the WP(C)
No.4837/2001, where the petitioner was the second amongst the seven petitioners.
He projects that this Court while considering the termination order dated 30.5.2001,
had observed that the alscharge should be only after affording opportunity, to the
affected teacher and here the counsel argues the soeaking order is passed without

affording any hearing.

4.1. On the other hand, Mr. N. Sarma, the learned standing counsel for the
Department of Secondary Education submits that the petitioner was never legally
appointed in accordance with Rule 3(1)(a) & (b) of the Assam Elementary Education
(Provincialisation) Rules, 1977 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Elementary Education
Rules’), in aS much as, the so called select list dated 5.3.2001, was never
authenticated or published by the DEE, as is mandated by Sub-Rule (b) of Rule 3(1)
of the Elementary Education Rules.

4,2. |The departmental lawyer refers to the ongoing screening process undertaken
by the Education Department to identify the huge number of illegal appointment of
teachers in the State and contend that preliminary findings show that, only 136
teachers were lawfully appointed amongst around 12000 illegal appointments made
during 1991—2001. Accordingly, it is argued that the relief cannot be allowed to any
such appointee, until his/her appointment status is established to be bonafide, by
the screening process.

4.3. The respondents further contend that the Expert Committee which met on
26.9.2008, in pursuant to the Court’s direction in the WP(C) No.1816/2006, had
verified that the petitioner was illegally appointed during the ban period, without the
necessary clearance of the SLEC and the list in which her name appeared, was
never approved by the DEE. It is therefore argued that the petitioner is disentitled

to claim legitimacy, for her appointment.

Writ Petition (C) No.1015/2009 3 of 7
5. The case of the petitioner is that in pursuant to the advertisement issued on
28.12.1996, by the DEE, Assam, she applied for the post of LP school teachers and
her name was enlisted at SI. No.64, in the list dated 5.3.2001, prepared for the
North Lakhimpur Sub-Division. Therefore, the appointment letter issued on
31.3.2001, is contended to be through due process. As the appointed teacher was
deputed to undergo the J unior Basic Training Course at DIET, Biswanath Chariali on
19.4.2004 and she was declared to have successfully completed the Training on
8.12.2004, the legitimacy to the appointment and continuation of service is claimed,
by the LP school teacher.

6. The recruitment of teachers in L.P. Schools is governed by the Elementary
Education Rules. The Rule 3 thereof (prior to the substitutions made on 10.11.2015
and 20.10.2012), being relevant and applicable for the petitioner’s appointment, is
extracted here-in-below for ready reference: 
“3.(I)(a) Method of recruitment:- In the month of January every year the MemberSecretary of the Selection Board shall invite applications in prescribed form, with
application fee through advertisement in newspapers from desirous candidates
registered with Employment Exchange prescribing minimum qualifications, number of
posts Scheduled Tribes, other Backward Classes etc. for vacancies of Elementary School
Teachers, Assam Legislative Assembly constituency-wise existing in the year in the SubDivision. The amount of application fee shall be Rs.25/-. The State Government may
revise the amount of application fee from time to time.

(b) The Selection Board, on receipt of applications, shall scrutinize and process the
application forms, the mark sheet and other necessary testimonials of the candidates for
interview by the Interview Committee. The Selection Board, on completion of interviews
by the different Interview Committees, shall add marks secured by different candidates in
the interview, the marks secured due to qualifications of the candidates over and above
the minimum qualification and the marks secured due to experience as a teacher, in the
manner provided in Schedule-I and prepare a list constituency-wise for each Assam
Legislative Assembly Constituency in descending order of the total marks secured by a
candidates out of the total marks mentioned in Schedule-I. Therefore, having provided
for reservation the Selection Board shall finalize the select list constituency-wise for
each Assam Legislative Assembly Constituency of only as many successful candidates as
are the advertised vacancies with Roll Numbers and names of the candidates in order of
merit and submit the lists to the Director of Elementary Education, Assam. If there is no
vacancy of teacher in the School falling in a Legislative Assembly Constituency no select
list shall be prepared. The Director shall authenticate and get the select list so prepared
published by affixing copy thereof in the Office Notice Board of the Director, Elementary
Education, Assam. Inspector of Schools, District Elementary Education Officer, Block
Elementary Education Officer and Deputy Inspector of Schools and in any other manner
as the Government may deed fit as and when they are received from different SubDivisions. The select lists containing the results shall be public documents and shall be
made available to a bona fide member of the public on application with such requisite
fees as may be determined by the Government from time to time. The Deputy Inspector of

Writ Petition (C) No. 1015/2009 4 of 7
Schools or the District Elementary Education Officer as the case may be, shall appoint
the selected candidates in order of merits only from this authenticated select lists. Any
appointment given to persons outside the select lists shall be ab-initio invalid except the
appointment given on compassionate ground by the Government as per rules of the
Government in this regard. The validity of the lists shall not extent beyond one year from
the date of its publication.”

7. As can be seen from the above Aules, constituency wise selection is
envisaged and the prepared list should then be submitted to the DEE. Most
Importantly, when there is no vacancy in the schools of a particular Legislative
Assembly Constituency, the select list need not be approved or published for that
Constituency. The Director must authenticate the prepared list and what ts of
extreme significance is that, appointment can only be made, from the authenticated
select list.

8. Let me now examine the legality of the DEE’s decision challenged in this
case. The impugned speaking order dated 7.1.2009 (Annexure-K), refers to double
gopointments against one post. On this controversy, the DI of Schools, North
Lakhimpur on 8.9.2009, had furnished a reoort which reflects that when the
Incumbency list was prepared by the DEEO, Lakhimpur for the year 2003—04, the
petitioner’s name was dropped in order to accommodate another person and that is
how, two incumbents were posted against one vacant post. This report reflects that
the double appointment was not at the stage when the petitioner was initially
Inducted on 31.3.2001 but it is relatable to the phase when the appointee was
deputed to undergo the Junior Basic Training Course at Biswanath Chariali, on
19.4.2004. Therefore, | am of the considered opinion that the double appointment
cannot by itself be an acceptable justification to hold that the petitioner was illegally
appointed.

9, The next issue which the Court needs to address is whether the list prepared
on 5.3.2001, by the North Lakhimpur Sub-Divisional Committee, was ever
authenticated or published, in accordance with the Rule 3(/)(b) of the Elementary
Education Rules. \n none of the Court proceedings, relating to the appointments in
LP schools of North Lakhimpur Sub-Division, the legitimacy of the list prepared by
the Sub-Divisional Level Committee, was ever examined by the Court. In fact, it is
not even the case of the petitioner that the list In which her name appeared at Sl.
No.64, was ever authenticated by the DEE or published, as per the requirement of

Elementary Education Rules. Therefore, the claim of bonafide appointment from

Writ Petition (C) No.1015/2009 5 of 7
such un-authenticated and un-published select list, will have to be considered and
decided, in this case.

10. — In the Court’s judgment in the WP(C) No.3408/2012 (Hem Chandra Borah &
52 others vs. State of Assam & others), the learned Judge observed that when
appointments are made during the enforcement of the model code of conduct and
there was absence of SLEC clearance, such defects are curable and ex-post facto
approval for the appointment can also be granted by the Staff Inspection Unit (SIU),
of the Finance Department. On that basis, the case of the 33 litigants in the WP(C)
No.3408/2012 was directed to be placed before the Finance (SIU) Department for
the ex-post facto approval. On the basis of the Court’s verdict, the Assam
Government created 33 suoermnumerary posts w.e.f. 1.9.2004 and the concerned
litigants in the WP(C) No.3408/2012, were then regularized in those supemumerary
posts, under the common order dated 31.12.2016, issued by the DEE, Assam.

11. The creation of supernumerary posts, w.e.f. 1.9.2004, for the concerned
litigants suggest that vacancies were not available when appointments were given
In the North Lakhimpur Sub-Division on the basis of the so called select list dated
5.3.2001. Moreover, the ongoing screening process undertaken by the Education
Department, was also under Court’s rader and the learned J udge himself clarified
that opinion is not expressed, on the merit of the State’s screening process.

12. In my perception, the verdict in the WP(C) No.3408/2012 (Hem Chandra
Borah & 32 others vs. State of Assam & others), does not confer absolute legitimacy
to the appointments made from the list prepared on 5.3.2001, by the North
Lakhimpur Sub-Divisional Level Committee. In fact, the Court had no occasion to
determine whether the list prepared on 5.3.2001, was ever published or was
authenticated by the DEE, as required by the Ru/es with due regard to the vacancies
available for appointment. Therefore, the validity of the list under the E/ementary
Education Rules, will have to be decided by the authority.

13. On the other hand, large number of litigants whose names figured in the list
of 5.3.2001, were regularized on 13.12.2016 by creation of supernumerary posts for
them w.e.f. 1.9.2004. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to say that the petitioner
IS not entitled to claim parity of relief, under the ratio of State of Karnataka vs. C.
Lalitha reported in (2006) 2 SCC 747.

14. The impugned speaking order dated 7.1.2009 (Annexure-K), passed by the

DEE, Assam, was in pursuant to the direction issued by this Court in the petitioner’s

Writ Petition (C) No.1015/2009 6 of 7
case I.e. in the WP(C) No.1816/2006. The Director had definitely observed that the
list prepared by the Sub-Divisional Level Advisory Board, North Lakhimpur was not
aooroved by the DEE. But at the same time, appointments made from that list have
been adjusted/regularized, by creation of supernumerary posts, on the basis of the
verdict in the WP(C) No.3408/2012. It is also important to be aware that when it
was announced that the appointments made during the ban period are illegal and
void ab initio, in the general termination order dated 30.5.2001, this Court in the
case filed by the petitioner i.e. WP(C) No.4837/2001, had observed that the
termination can be enforced only after affording due opportunity, to the concerned
Incumbent.

15. Following the above and more particularly the fact that the soeaking order
dated 7.1.2009 (Annexure-K), was passed without affording any hearing to the
petitioner, whose service was discontinued, | deem it appropriate to remit the
matter back to the authorities for fresh consideration, in light of the observation
made in this judgment. The fresh consideration is ordered to be made by the
Commissioner & Secretary to the Department of Elementary Education and not by
the DEE. During the process, hearing be afforded to the petitioner. The impugned
speaking order dated 7.1.2009 (Annexure-K) and the consequential order of
5.2.2009 (Annexure-L), will abide by the Commissioner’s final decision, under this
order. The ordered exercise should be carried out expeditiously and preferably
within four months from today. It is ordered accordingly.

16. With the above order, the case stands disposed of. No cost.

Writ Petition (C) No. 1015/2009 1 of 7
J UDGEMENT AND ORDER (ORAL)

Heard Mr. N. Borah, the learned counsel for the petitioner. The learned
standing counsel for the Department of Secondary Education, Mr. N. Sarma appears
for the respondent Nos.1—4. The respondent No.5 & 7 are represented by Mr. P.
Nayak, the learned standing counsel for the Finance Department. The Headmaster

of the Sonia Gandhi L.P. School (respondent No.6) is, however un-represented.

2. The petitioner was appointed on 31.3.2001 (Annexure-A), as a fixed pay
teacher by the DI of Schools, North Lakhimpur, in the Sonia Gandhi L.P. School. She
challenges the soeaking order dated 7.1.2009 (Annexure-K), whereby following the
Court’s direction dated 26.4.2006 (Annexure-H), in the WP(C) No.1816/2006, the
Director of Elementary Education (DEE), Assam, has considered and rejected the
Salary claim. The DEE has concluded that the petitioner's appointment (on
31.3.2001), was during the ban period and no clearance of the State Level
Empowered Committee (SLEC) was obtained, for the appointment. Moreover, the
list prepared by the Sub-Divisional Level Advisory Board, North Lakhimpur, was not
approved by the DEE. Thus, her appointment was declared to be illegal and on that
basis, direction was issued to discontinue the service of the illegal appointee. The
consequential order was then issued on 5.2.2009 (Annexure-L), whereby the DI of
Schools, North Lakhimpur has directed the petitioner to not to attend the school and
the school Head Teacher was also instructed, to stop the teacher for discharging her

service.

3.1. Assailing the legality of the two impugned orders, the learned counsel Mr. N.
Borah submits that the petitioner’s name appeared at SI. No.64 of the select list
dated 5.3.2001 and therefore, legal justification for appointment of the selected

candidate, is claimed by the petitioner’s lawyer.

3.2. On the absence of clearance of the SLEC for the appointment, made during
the ban period, the learned counsel reads the judgment dated 10.3.2015, in the
WP(C) No.3408/2012 (Hem Chandra Borah & 32 others vs. State of Assam &
others), to argue that these are procedural defects and are curable and accordingly
It is submitted that ex-post facto approval to the appointment by the SLEC [Now
Staff Inspection Unit (SIU)] can be considered for the petitioner, as was done for
the 33 litigants, in the WP(C) No.3408/2012.

Writ Petition (C) No. 1015/2009 2 of 7
3.3. Since as many as 33 supernumerary posts were created for the 33
petitioners, of the WP(C) No.3408/2012, the learned counsel Mr. N. Borah submits
that the petitioner should also be similarly adjusted in a supernumerary post, in

order to ensure parity of relief, for the similarly situated incumbents.

3.4. As regards the general direction issued on 30.5.2001, for cancellation of
appointment of those inducted during the ban period without following the due
process, the counsel refers to the order dated 27.11.2003, in the WP(C)
No.4837/2001, where the petitioner was the second amongst the seven petitioners.
He projects that this Court while considering the termination order dated 30.5.2001,
had observed that the alscharge should be only after affording opportunity, to the
affected teacher and here the counsel argues the soeaking order is passed without

affording any hearing.

4.1. On the other hand, Mr. N. Sarma, the learned standing counsel for the
Department of Secondary Education submits that the petitioner was never legally
appointed in accordance with Rule 3(1)(a) & (b) of the Assam Elementary Education
(Provincialisation) Rules, 1977 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Elementary Education
Rules’), in aS much as, the so called select list dated 5.3.2001, was never
authenticated or published by the DEE, as is mandated by Sub-Rule (b) of Rule 3(1)
of the Elementary Education Rules.

4,2. |The departmental lawyer refers to the ongoing screening process undertaken
by the Education Department to identify the huge number of illegal appointment of
teachers in the State and contend that preliminary findings show that, only 136
teachers were lawfully appointed amongst around 12000 illegal appointments made
during 1991—2001. Accordingly, it is argued that the relief cannot be allowed to any
such appointee, until his/her appointment status is established to be bonafide, by
the screening process.

4.3. The respondents further contend that the Expert Committee which met on
26.9.2008, in pursuant to the Court’s direction in the WP(C) No.1816/2006, had
verified that the petitioner was illegally appointed during the ban period, without the
necessary clearance of the SLEC and the list in which her name appeared, was
never approved by the DEE. It is therefore argued that the petitioner is disentitled

to claim legitimacy, for her appointment.

Writ Petition (C) No.1015/2009 3 of 7
5. The case of the petitioner is that in pursuant to the advertisement issued on
28.12.1996, by the DEE, Assam, she applied for the post of LP school teachers and
her name was enlisted at SI. No.64, in the list dated 5.3.2001, prepared for the
North Lakhimpur Sub-Division. Therefore, the appointment letter issued on
31.3.2001, is contended to be through due process. As the appointed teacher was
deputed to undergo the J unior Basic Training Course at DIET, Biswanath Chariali on
19.4.2004 and she was declared to have successfully completed the Training on
8.12.2004, the legitimacy to the appointment and continuation of service is claimed,
by the LP school teacher.

6. The recruitment of teachers in L.P. Schools is governed by the Elementary
Education Rules. The Rule 3 thereof (prior to the substitutions made on 10.11.2015
and 20.10.2012), being relevant and applicable for the petitioner’s appointment, is
extracted here-in-below for ready reference: 
“3.(I)(a) Method of recruitment:- In the month of January every year the MemberSecretary of the Selection Board shall invite applications in prescribed form, with
application fee through advertisement in newspapers from desirous candidates
registered with Employment Exchange prescribing minimum qualifications, number of
posts Scheduled Tribes, other Backward Classes etc. for vacancies of Elementary School
Teachers, Assam Legislative Assembly constituency-wise existing in the year in the SubDivision. The amount of application fee shall be Rs.25/-. The State Government may
revise the amount of application fee from time to time.

(b) The Selection Board, on receipt of applications, shall scrutinize and process the
application forms, the mark sheet and other necessary testimonials of the candidates for
interview by the Interview Committee. The Selection Board, on completion of interviews
by the different Interview Committees, shall add marks secured by different candidates in
the interview, the marks secured due to qualifications of the candidates over and above
the minimum qualification and the marks secured due to experience as a teacher, in the
manner provided in Schedule-I and prepare a list constituency-wise for each Assam
Legislative Assembly Constituency in descending order of the total marks secured by a
candidates out of the total marks mentioned in Schedule-I. Therefore, having provided
for reservation the Selection Board shall finalize the select list constituency-wise for
each Assam Legislative Assembly Constituency of only as many successful candidates as
are the advertised vacancies with Roll Numbers and names of the candidates in order of
merit and submit the lists to the Director of Elementary Education, Assam. If there is no
vacancy of teacher in the School falling in a Legislative Assembly Constituency no select
list shall be prepared. The Director shall authenticate and get the select list so prepared
published by affixing copy thereof in the Office Notice Board of the Director, Elementary
Education, Assam. Inspector of Schools, District Elementary Education Officer, Block
Elementary Education Officer and Deputy Inspector of Schools and in any other manner
as the Government may deed fit as and when they are received from different SubDivisions. The select lists containing the results shall be public documents and shall be
made available to a bona fide member of the public on application with such requisite
fees as may be determined by the Government from time to time. The Deputy Inspector of

Writ Petition (C) No. 1015/2009 4 of 7
Schools or the District Elementary Education Officer as the case may be, shall appoint
the selected candidates in order of merits only from this authenticated select lists. Any
appointment given to persons outside the select lists shall be ab-initio invalid except the
appointment given on compassionate ground by the Government as per rules of the
Government in this regard. The validity of the lists shall not extent beyond one year from
the date of its publication.”

7. As can be seen from the above Aules, constituency wise selection is
envisaged and the prepared list should then be submitted to the DEE. Most
Importantly, when there is no vacancy in the schools of a particular Legislative
Assembly Constituency, the select list need not be approved or published for that
Constituency. The Director must authenticate the prepared list and what ts of
extreme significance is that, appointment can only be made, from the authenticated
select list.

8. Let me now examine the legality of the DEE’s decision challenged in this
case. The impugned speaking order dated 7.1.2009 (Annexure-K), refers to double
gopointments against one post. On this controversy, the DI of Schools, North
Lakhimpur on 8.9.2009, had furnished a reoort which reflects that when the
Incumbency list was prepared by the DEEO, Lakhimpur for the year 2003—04, the
petitioner’s name was dropped in order to accommodate another person and that is
how, two incumbents were posted against one vacant post. This report reflects that
the double appointment was not at the stage when the petitioner was initially
Inducted on 31.3.2001 but it is relatable to the phase when the appointee was
deputed to undergo the Junior Basic Training Course at Biswanath Chariali, on
19.4.2004. Therefore, | am of the considered opinion that the double appointment
cannot by itself be an acceptable justification to hold that the petitioner was illegally
appointed.

9, The next issue which the Court needs to address is whether the list prepared
on 5.3.2001, by the North Lakhimpur Sub-Divisional Committee, was ever
authenticated or published, in accordance with the Rule 3(/)(b) of the Elementary
Education Rules. \n none of the Court proceedings, relating to the appointments in
LP schools of North Lakhimpur Sub-Division, the legitimacy of the list prepared by
the Sub-Divisional Level Committee, was ever examined by the Court. In fact, it is
not even the case of the petitioner that the list In which her name appeared at Sl.
No.64, was ever authenticated by the DEE or published, as per the requirement of

Elementary Education Rules. Therefore, the claim of bonafide appointment from

Writ Petition (C) No.1015/2009 5 of 7
such un-authenticated and un-published select list, will have to be considered and
decided, in this case.

10. — In the Court’s judgment in the WP(C) No.3408/2012 (Hem Chandra Borah &
52 others vs. State of Assam & others), the learned Judge observed that when
appointments are made during the enforcement of the model code of conduct and
there was absence of SLEC clearance, such defects are curable and ex-post facto
approval for the appointment can also be granted by the Staff Inspection Unit (SIU),
of the Finance Department. On that basis, the case of the 33 litigants in the WP(C)
No.3408/2012 was directed to be placed before the Finance (SIU) Department for
the ex-post facto approval. On the basis of the Court’s verdict, the Assam
Government created 33 suoermnumerary posts w.e.f. 1.9.2004 and the concerned
litigants in the WP(C) No.3408/2012, were then regularized in those supemumerary
posts, under the common order dated 31.12.2016, issued by the DEE, Assam.

11. The creation of supernumerary posts, w.e.f. 1.9.2004, for the concerned
litigants suggest that vacancies were not available when appointments were given
In the North Lakhimpur Sub-Division on the basis of the so called select list dated
5.3.2001. Moreover, the ongoing screening process undertaken by the Education
Department, was also under Court’s rader and the learned J udge himself clarified
that opinion is not expressed, on the merit of the State’s screening process.

12. In my perception, the verdict in the WP(C) No.3408/2012 (Hem Chandra
Borah & 32 others vs. State of Assam & others), does not confer absolute legitimacy
to the appointments made from the list prepared on 5.3.2001, by the North
Lakhimpur Sub-Divisional Level Committee. In fact, the Court had no occasion to
determine whether the list prepared on 5.3.2001, was ever published or was
authenticated by the DEE, as required by the Ru/es with due regard to the vacancies
available for appointment. Therefore, the validity of the list under the E/ementary
Education Rules, will have to be decided by the authority.

13. On the other hand, large number of litigants whose names figured in the list
of 5.3.2001, were regularized on 13.12.2016 by creation of supernumerary posts for
them w.e.f. 1.9.2004. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to say that the petitioner
IS not entitled to claim parity of relief, under the ratio of State of Karnataka vs. C.
Lalitha reported in (2006) 2 SCC 747.

14. The impugned speaking order dated 7.1.2009 (Annexure-K), passed by the

DEE, Assam, was in pursuant to the direction issued by this Court in the petitioner’s

Writ Petition (C) No.1015/2009 6 of 7
case I.e. in the WP(C) No.1816/2006. The Director had definitely observed that the
list prepared by the Sub-Divisional Level Advisory Board, North Lakhimpur was not
aooroved by the DEE. But at the same time, appointments made from that list have
been adjusted/regularized, by creation of supernumerary posts, on the basis of the
verdict in the WP(C) No.3408/2012. It is also important to be aware that when it
was announced that the appointments made during the ban period are illegal and
void ab initio, in the general termination order dated 30.5.2001, this Court in the
case filed by the petitioner i.e. WP(C) No.4837/2001, had observed that the
termination can be enforced only after affording due opportunity, to the concerned
Incumbent.

15. Following the above and more particularly the fact that the soeaking order
dated 7.1.2009 (Annexure-K), was passed without affording any hearing to the
petitioner, whose service was discontinued, | deem it appropriate to remit the
matter back to the authorities for fresh consideration, in light of the observation
made in this judgment. The fresh consideration is ordered to be made by the
Commissioner & Secretary to the Department of Elementary Education and not by
the DEE. During the process, hearing be afforded to the petitioner. The impugned
speaking order dated 7.1.2009 (Annexure-K) and the consequential order of
5.2.2009 (Annexure-L), will abide by the Commissioner’s final decision, under this
order. The ordered exercise should be carried out expeditiously and preferably
within four months from today. It is ordered accordingly.

16. With the above order, the case stands disposed of. No cost.

J UDGMENT AND ORDER (ORAL)

Heard Mr. H. Talukdar, the learned counsel for the petitioners. The
respondents are represented by Mr. A. Deka, the learned standing counsel for the

Department of Elementary Education.

2. The two petitioners have common grievance relating to non-disbursal of
salary since they entered service. The 1% petitioner Srmt. Sadhana Pegu was
appointed on 09.06.1995 (Annexure-1A) by Mr /. Bora, the then D.I. of Schools,
Dhemaji, as a fixed pay teacher in the Sakai Namgharia Primary School. Similarly,
the 2™ petitioner $77 Prafulla Taid was appointed in the Bokajan Primary School

under a similar appointment order issued on 09.06.1995 (Annexure-1B).

3. Since both appointees were not paid their salary since inception, earlier
they filed the WP(C) No.4304/2003 along with two others to claim their dues. That

case was disposed of on 10.06.2003 (Annexure-2) with the following order:
eceocececeo eco eoeo eee eee eee eee

Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Govt. Advocate.

The case of the petitioner is that the petitioners were appointed as fixed pay
teacher at various schools vide order dated 9.6.95 passed by the Deputy Inspector
of Schools, Dhemaji. The grievance of the petitioners is that they have not been
paid their salaries since their joining till date.

Upon hearing the learned counsel for both sides, this writ petition is disposed of
with the direction to the respondents to examine and verify the claim of the
petitioners and if the petitioners are found to be appointed by the competent
authority in accordance with the rules and regulations against sanctioned post and
existing vacancies, and if they are otherwise eligible, their salaries be paid to them
within a period of three months from the date on which a copy of this order along
with a copy of this writ petition and Annexure thereof is produced by the
petitioners before the concerned authority. It is further provided that if the
petitioners are still in service they may be allowed to continue till regular
appointment as per the interview is made.

4. However aS no payment was received, the teachers have re-approached
the Court with this 2° writ petition. The petitioners contend that as they were
appointed in retirement vacancies by the then D.I. of Schools, Dhemaji, the denial

of their salary is unjustified. But at the same time, the learned counsel Mr. H.

WP(C)586/2012,— ss Rage 2 of 4
Talukdar concedes that he has no current instruction on whether the two

petitioners are still continuing their service.

5. On the other hand, the learned standing counsel Mr. A. Deka submits that
appointment of L.P. School teachers is governed by the Assam Elementary
Education (Provincalisation) Rules, 1977 (hereinafter referred to as the
“Elementary Education Rules”) and Rule 3(i)(a) & (6b) thereof prescribes the mode
of selection and appointment. Before selection exercise is undertaken, the process
has to be advertised and the DEE Is required to authenticate and published the
select list and only then appointment can be made from such authenticated select
list. The respondents contend that the appointment order does not show that the
petitioners were selected through a due process and accordingly the departmental
lawyer describes the petitioners’ appointment to be amongst the many illegal
appointment orders issued by the then D.I. of Schools, Dhemaji, “Mr /. Bora,

against whom, Departmental Proceeding was initiated.

6. The respondents argue that if unmerited appointments have been made
dehors the rules, the State is not obliged to take the burden of salary, for such

category of illegal appointees.

7. When appointments are made in violation of the mandatory provisions, on
the claim for salary, in Govt. of Andhra Pradesh Vs. K. Brahmanandam reported in
(2008)5 SCC 241, the Supreme Court observed as follows:
“14. The liability of the State to pay salary to a teacher appointed in the
recognized schools would arise provided the provisions of the statutory rules are
complied with, subject to just exception. The right to claim salary must arise under
a contract or under a statute. If such a right arises under a contract between the
appointee and the institution, only the latter would be liable therefor. Its right in
certain situation to claim reimbursement of such salary from the State would only
arise in terms of the law as was prevailing at the relevant time. If the State in terms
of the statute is not liable to pay the salary to the teachers, no legal right accrues in
favour of those who had been appointed in violation of mandatory provisions of
the statute or statutory rules.”

Ss. In a bunch of cases of teachers appointed in the Primary Schools of
Assam, the Supreme Court in Nazira Begum Lashkar Vs. State of Assam reported
IN (2001)1 SCC 143 had declared that if appointments are made dehors the rules
without following the procedure of advertisement and selection, equitable right is

not attracted, for the appointees.

WP(C)586/2012,— sss Page 3 of 4
9. Proceeding on the above basis, a prima facie examination of the
appointment order itself reflect that it was not preceded by any selection exercise

as is contemplated, under the Elementary Education Rules.

10. Be that as it may, in the absence of any counter affidavit from the side of
the respondents, it will be unfair to straightway reject the salary claim made by
the petitioners particularly in view of the judgment rendered earlier on 10.06.2003
(Annexure-2) in the WP(C) No.4304/2003. The least the petitioners are entitled is
to a fair consideration of their claim and this can be ensured by asking the Expert
Committee constituted by the Government on High Court’s direction, in Sudhendu
Mohan Talukdar Vs. State of Assam reported in 2006(2) GLT 216. The standing

counsel informs that the Expert Committee is still functional.

11. ~~ Having concluded thus, the petitioners are permitted to file individual
representation before the Commissioner & Secretary to the Govt. of Assam,
Education (Elementary) Department. When the representation(s) are received, the
Officer should facilitate consideration of the salary claim of the petitioners, by the
Expert Committee functioning under the authority of Sudhendu Mohan Talukdar
(Supra). Since the petitioners are litigating for a long time, the Expert Committee
should decide the matter expeditiously and preferably within a period of 8(eight)
weeks from receipt of the representation. While assessing the bonafide of the
claim, the Committee should determine whether the petitioners were appointed
through due process and for how long they have served. The ratio in K
Brahmanandam (supra) and Nazira Begum Lashkar (Supra) should also be borne

In mind, while deciding the merit of the claim. It is ordered accordingly.

12. With the above order, the case stands disposed of. No cost.

HON’BLE THE CHIEF J USTICE MR. Facts leading to the institution of the present writ petition by
the Union of India may be noticed. On his death
on 26.10.1997, Munni Devi made representation for grant of family
pension. The same was disposed of on 26.11.2012 by holding that there was
no merit in the O.A. as Munni Devi was sleeping over her rights and

no proper explanation was offered as to the inordinate delay in

Page 1of4
making claim for family pension. However, a direction was made to
consider the representation dated 22.02.2012 made by Munni Devi as
per law. This Court also held that the refusal on
the part of the Tribunal to adjudicate upon the rights of Munni Devi
was not tenable in law. 23.08.1980 and, since thereafter, neither the suspension
was revoked nor was he reinstated. If what

the petitioner contends is true, the respondents have the
responsibility to do the needful in accordance with law.” In terms of the directions made in WP(C) 1222/2013, the
Railway Authority passed Speaking Order dated 26.06.2013 rejecting
the claim of Munni Devi, which again constrained Munni Devi to
institute O.A. No. As the respondents submitted, due to non-availability
of record, they could not settle the family pension, this Court
directs the Railways to use the information available in the office
order dated 24.09.1975 where along with the name of the
applicant, other employees’ names have been given along with
date of confirmation. of the applicant be calculated on prorate service

basis and disbursed along with other benefits as per GPF
records.” On the basis of the statement of Sri Shankar Chandra Dey,
the petitioner has filed the present writ petition challenging the order
of the Tribunal and also denying any liability to pay family pension to
Munni Devi. The argument advanced is that since late Sohan Singh
was removed from service, aS such, there was no question for paying

any retirement benefits and family pension to the widow. Sadly, not an iota of
evidence could be produced by the petitioner, save and except, the
Statement of Sri Shankar Chandra Dey. Also, no service record of late

Sohan Singh could be produced. J ustification made is that no records

Page 3 of 4
whatsoever are available in the office with regard to the service

career of late Sohan Singh. It is well settled in law that burden lies on the party if a point is
to be established. In this view of the matter we are not
impressed or satisfied with the stand taken by the petitioners. In the
absence of any tangible evidence, the only reasonable view open to
this Court is that merely on the basis of a statement that late Sohan
Singh was removed from service, the benefits to which Munni Devi Is
legitimately entitled to, cannot be denied. In this view of the matter, a
direction is made to the petitioners to work out and pay the
retirement benefits as due to Munni Devi on the demise of her
husband who was a confirmed employee under the N.F. Railways,
Lumding Division. 303/2012 was instituted by Munni Devi before the
Central Administrative Tribunal, Guwahati Bench. The present writ petition accordingly fails and stands
dismissed. J) UDGE CHI EF J USTICE

1. Facts leading to the institution of the present writ petition by
the Union of India may be noticed. The sole respondent Smt. Munni
Devi is the widow of late Sohan Singh who served N.F. Railways,
Lumding Division as a Sanitary Cleaner, initially on temporary basis.
His service was confirmed with effect from 13.09.1971. On his death
on 26.10.1997, Munni Devi made representation for grant of family
pension. As the same was not forthcoming, she filed O.A. No.
303/2012 before the Central Administrative Tribunal, Guwahati Bench.
The same was disposed of on 26.11.2012 by holding that there was
no merit in the O.A. as Munni Devi was sleeping over her rights and

no proper explanation was offered as to the inordinate delay in

Page 1of4
making claim for family pension. However, a direction was made to
consider the representation dated 22.02.2012 made by Munni Devi as
per law. This order of the Tribunal dated 26.11.2012 was assailed in
WP(C) 1222/2013 and this Court disposed of the same on 09.04.2013
with direction to the concerned Railway Authorities to consider her
case and to take a decision thereon in accordance with law. In the
said order of this Court dated 09.04.2013 it was observed that a
person’s right to receive pension is a right in continuity and such right
cannot be said to have been barred by law if she was otherwise
entitled to receive pension. This Court also held that the refusal on
the part of the Tribunal to adjudicate upon the rights of Munni Devi
was not tenable in law. This Court also noted as follows:

“It is also imperative to note that if what the petitioner
contends is true, her husband, while working on temporary
basis, aS Sanitary Cleaner, had been placed under suspension
w.e.f. 23.08.1980 and, since thereafter, neither the suspension
was revoked nor was he reinstated. At the same time, according
to the petitioner, as already indicated above, no disciplinary
proceeding was drawn against her husband and when the matter
remained so poised, her husband died on 28.10.1997. If what

the petitioner contends is true, the respondents have the
responsibility to do the needful in accordance with law.”

2. In terms of the directions made in WP(C) 1222/2013, the
Railway Authority passed Speaking Order dated 26.06.2013 rejecting
the claim of Munni Devi, which again constrained Munni Devi to
institute O.A. No. 243/2013. Before the Tribunal Munni Devi filed an
affidavit on 03.02.2014 to bring on record eight documents, on
consideration of which the Tribunal concluded that even if late Sohan
Singh was placed under suspension, the operation of the order could
not have subsisted beyond 1981, which is the year where GPF
contribution receipt was available on record. The Tribunal also took

note of the stand of the Railway Authorities as regards non-availability

Page 2 of 4
of records, as a result of which family pension could not be settled. In
this respect, the Tribunal directed as follows:
“14. As the respondents submitted, due to non-availability
of record, they could not settle the family pension, this Court
directs the Railways to use the information available in the office
order dated 24.09.1975 where along with the name of the
applicant, other employees’ names have been given along with
date of confirmation. On the basis of next below rule, family
pension etc. of the applicant be calculated on prorate service

basis and disbursed along with other benefits as per GPF
records.”

Accordingly, O.A. No. 243/2013 was allowed with direction to the
Railway authorities to disburse the post retirement benefits including

GPF and Pension within a period of three month.

3. According to the petitioners herein, for the purpose of
effectuating the Tribunal’s order, an enquiry was set In motion and in
the course of the said enquiry the statement of one Sri Sankar
Chandra Dey was recorded on 05.09.2014, who stated that he had
worked with late Sohan Singh and that late Sohan Singh remained
absent from duty now and then and eventually he was removed from
service. On the basis of the statement of Sri Shankar Chandra Dey,
the petitioner has filed the present writ petition challenging the order
of the Tribunal and also denying any liability to pay family pension to
Munni Devi. The argument advanced is that since late Sohan Singh
was removed from service, aS such, there was no question for paying

any retirement benefits and family pension to the widow.

A. To test the stand of the petitioners, this Court called upon the
counsel representing the petitioner to demonstrate from records the
fact of removal of late Sohan Singh from service. Sadly, not an iota of
evidence could be produced by the petitioner, save and except, the
Statement of Sri Shankar Chandra Dey. Also, no service record of late

Sohan Singh could be produced. J ustification made is that no records

Page 3 of 4
whatsoever are available in the office with regard to the service

career of late Sohan Singh.

5. It is well settled in law that burden lies on the party if a point is
to be established. The dispute raised with regard to the alleged
removal from service is only a bald statement shred of any
documentary support. In this view of the matter we are not
impressed or satisfied with the stand taken by the petitioners. The
ground taken to deny retirement and pension benefits to Munni Devi
does not stand vindicated by any supporting documents. In the
absence of any tangible evidence, the only reasonable view open to
this Court is that merely on the basis of a statement that late Sohan
Singh was removed from service, the benefits to which Munni Devi Is
legitimately entitled to, cannot be denied. In this view of the matter, a
direction is made to the petitioners to work out and pay the
retirement benefits as due to Munni Devi on the demise of her
husband who was a confirmed employee under the N.F. Railways,
Lumding Division. In so far aS payment of family pension is
concerned, a direction is made to pay the same with effect from the
period prior to three years from the date when the first Original
Application No. 303/2012 was instituted by Munni Devi before the
Central Administrative Tribunal, Guwahati Bench. Ordered
accordingly. The present writ petition accordingly fails and stands
dismissed. The direction of the Tribunal in its Order dated 28.05.2014
in O.A. No. 243/2013 stands modified to the extent above. No costs.

For respondent Nos. J USTICE ARUP KUMAR GOSWAMI

J) UDGMENT AND ORDER (ORAL)

Heard Ms. J. Kalita, learned counsel appearing for the writ petitioner. The petitioner is the son of late Sadat Ali, who was the Gaonburah of the said
village. 5 is the grandson of late Sadat
All, being son of Md. Sultan Ali, another son of late Sadat Ali. On the death of Sadat Ali,
an advertisement dated 24.06.2013 was issued by the Deputy Commissioner
(Gaonburah Branch), Nagaon, inviting applications for recruitment to the said post of
Gaonburah fixing the last date for submission of application on 08.07.2013. 5 had secured highest marks
In the interview and the writ petitioner had secured the least marks. It is also stated
In the affidavit that the report of the Mouzadar was also taken into consideration and,
thereafter, finding that the respondent No. 5 is the most suitable candidate, he was

appointed as the Gaonburah. It is further stated that as the advertisement was for a

WP(C) 1375/2014
lone post of Gaonburah and as there is no provision for maintaining Wait List, the

question of publication of select list did not arise. 5 was aged about 22 years and that he was studying HSSLC

course. However, the said report of the Circle Officer was not taken into consideration. It is
also pleaded that 980 villagers submitted a representation before the respondent No. 5 as the suitable person for the post of Gaonburah
of the village in question. 5 was selected on the
basis of relevant considerations and that there is no infirmity in the process of selection
and appointment. 5 regarding maintainability of the writ petition has got no force. Even otherwise, wishes of the family of the Gaonburah in terms of Section 162A of the
1886 Regulation is a consideration which cannot be wished away. 9, By placing reliance on the case of Mahbubur Rahman vs. State of Assam and
Ors., In Mahbubur Rahman (supra), taking note of the provisions contained in the
Regulation of 1886, this Court had held that Clause 162B and 162C are to be read
conjointly and a conjoint reading of the same will go to show that there is a provision
for appeal against an order of appointment/suspension/dismissal of a Gaonburah. In the instant case, having noticed the order dated 12.3.2014, | am of the
considered opinion that it will be wholly inequitable to relegate the petitioner at this
distance of time to seek alternative remedy and therefore, the argument advanced by
Mr. Matin and Mr. Ali for dismissal of the writ petition on the ground of availability of

alternative remedy is repelled. In Promode Chandra Roy (supra), this Court found that the claims of the family
members of the Gaonburah and the view of the Mouzadar were not taken into
consideration at all and, thus, relevant considerations under Clause 162A of the
Executive Instructions having not been taken into account, this Court had set aside the
order of appointment made in favour of the selected candidate and had remitted the
matter for fresh consideration limiting the exercise to the persons who had responded

to the advertisement in question. A perusal of the Compilation-sheet of oral test held for appointment to the post
of Gaonburah at page 227 of the records produced by Mr. Tai goes to show that, in all,
30 marks were assigned on three components: (i) Education, (Ii) General Knowledge

and (lil) Experience, and 10 marks were allotted to each of the components. It appears that Additional Deputy Commissioner |n-charge, Gaonburah Branch,
Sub-Divisional Officer (Sadar), Gaonburah Branch and Circle Officer, Gaonburah Branch
were the members of the Selection Board. |
am unable to subscribe to the submission of the learned counsel for the respondent No. 5 that the writ petition raises any disputed question of fact. The Court is only required to examine the decision

making process. Such exercise shall
be completed within a period of four months from the date of receipt of a certified copy
of this order.","IN THE GAUHATI HIGH COURT

HON’BLE MR. J USTICE ARUP KUMAR GOSWAMI

J) UDGMENT AND ORDER (ORAL)

Heard Ms. J. Kalita, learned counsel appearing for the writ petitioner. Also heard
Mr. A. Tai, learned State counsel, appearing for respondent Nos. 1 to 4 as well as Mr.

A. Matin and Mr. H. Ali, learned counsel appearing for respondent No. 5.

WP(C) 1375/2014
2. By this writ application, the petitioner prays for a direction to set aside the order
dated 27.11.2013 issued by the respondent No. 3, I.e., Deputy Commissioner
(Gaonburah Branch), Nagaon, whereby the respondent No. 5 was appointed as the
Gaonburah of Gerajai Pam Lot/Kisamat, under Gerubat Mouza, in the District of

Nagaon.

3. The petitioner is the son of late Sadat Ali, who was the Gaonburah of the said
village. Sadat Ali died on 10.04.2013. Respondent No. 5 is the grandson of late Sadat
All, being son of Md. Sultan Ali, another son of late Sadat Ali. On the death of Sadat Ali,
an advertisement dated 24.06.2013 was issued by the Deputy Commissioner
(Gaonburah Branch), Nagaon, inviting applications for recruitment to the said post of
Gaonburah fixing the last date for submission of application on 08.07.2013. The date of

interview was fixed on 29.10.2013.

4. The allegations made in the writ petition are that after the interview was held,
without declaring the result and without publishing the select list, appointment order
was issued in favour of respondent No. 5 appointing him as the Gaonburah. It is
pleaded that such appointment of the respondent No. 5 was made without considering
the relevant factors as provided under Clause 162A of the Executive Instructions of the
Assam Land and Revenue Regulation, 1886 (for short, “Regulation of 1886”). It is also
pleaded that the claims of the family members of the late Gaonburah and the views of
the Mouzadar were not at all taken into consideration while giving appointment to the

respondent No. 5.

5. Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 had filed an affidavit and while denying the allegations
made in the writ petition, it is stated that respondent No. 5 had secured highest marks
In the interview and the writ petitioner had secured the least marks. It is also stated
that the interview was held on 29.10.2013 and the appointment order was issued on
27.11.2013, i.e., after a lapse of almost one month and not hurriedly as contended by
the petitioner and that all relevant considerations, as enjoined by Clause 162A of the
Executive Instructions were taken into consideration. |n support of the candidature of
respondent No. 5, more than 900 persons had submitted a petition and, on top of that,
during the lifetime of late Sadat Ali, he himself had submitted a petition on 28.02.2013
requesting appointment of respondent No. 5 as Gaonburah in his place. It is also stated
In the affidavit that the report of the Mouzadar was also taken into consideration and,
thereafter, finding that the respondent No. 5 is the most suitable candidate, he was

appointed as the Gaonburah. It is further stated that as the advertisement was for a

WP(C) 1375/2014
lone post of Gaonburah and as there is no provision for maintaining Wait List, the

question of publication of select list did not arise.

6. In the reply affidavit, it is stated that on 06.11.2013, the mother of the
petitioner had submitted a representation praying for appointment of the petitioner as
Gaonburah and without taking into consideration the said representation, appointment
was Offered to respondent No. 5. It is also pleaded that the Circle Officer, Kampur
Revenue Circle, had submitted a report dated 24.06.2013, wherein it was mentioned
that the respondent No. 5 was aged about 22 years and that he was studying HSSLC

course. However, the said report of the Circle Officer was not taken into consideration.

7. Respondent No. 5 had also filed an affidavit in opposition taking a plea that the
writ petition is not maintainable in view of efficacious and alternative remedy being
available to the writ petitioner under Clause 162B of the Executive Instructions. It is
also pleaded that 980 villagers submitted a representation before the respondent No. 2
recommending the respondent No. 5 as the suitable person for the post of Gaonburah
of the village in question. Further plea is that respondent No. 5 was selected on the
basis of relevant considerations and that there is no infirmity in the process of selection
and appointment. It is also pleaded that a written complaint was filed before
respondent No. 2 by the father of the respondent No. 5 regarding doubtful educational
qualification certificate of the petitioner and that in respect of the same, an enquiry was
conducted by the Circle Officer, who had submitted a report dated 07.10.2013 stating
that the certificate obtained by the petitioner from Madhabpara High School is forged

and fake.

8. The learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the writ petition was
entertained on 12.3.2014 and direction was issued to the learned State counsel for
production of records and it was also recorded therein that an endeavour will be made
to dispose of the writ petition and therefore, at this point of time, the plea raised by the
respondent No. 5 regarding maintainability of the writ petition has got no force. She
has submitted that the petitioner being the son of the Gaonburah and the mother of
the petitioner having submitted a representation before the select list was published, it
was incumbent on the part of the respondents to have considered such representation.
Even otherwise, wishes of the family of the Gaonburah in terms of Section 162A of the
1886 Regulation is a consideration which cannot be wished away. It is also submitted
that the view of the Mouzadar was not taken into consideration before selection of

respondent No. 5 was made. Ms Kalita has placed reliance on the decision rendered in

WP(C) 1375/2014
the case of Promode Chanatra Roy vs. State of Assam & ors., reported in 2006 (2) GLT
604.

9, By placing reliance on the case of Mahbubur Rahman vs. State of Assam and
Ors., reported in 2005 (4) GLT 397, Mr. Matin and Mr. Ali have submitted that in view
of availability of alternative remedy, the writ petition ought to be dismissed. Mr. Ali has
submitted that the decision rendered in the case of Promode Chandra Roy (supra) will
not be attracted in the fact situation of this case, in as much as, in the said case the
writ petition was filed after exhaustion of all the remedies available under the
Regulation of 1886. He has also submitted that the writ petition raises disputed
questions of facts and accordingly, placing reliance on an order of this Court dated
5.12.2012 passed in WP(C) No. 9457/2003 (Idrish Ali vs. State of Assam and ors.), it is
submitted that this Court ought not to invoke its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India. He has further submitted the selection and appointment of
respondent No 5, in any case, having been made in accordance with law, this petition Is

liable to be dismissed.

10. By producing records, Mr. Tai has submitted that no interference is called for

with regard to the selection and appointment of respondent No. 5.

11. | have considered the submissions of the learned counsel for the parties and

have perused the records of the case as well as the records produced by Mr. Tai.

12. In Mahbubur Rahman (supra), taking note of the provisions contained in the
Regulation of 1886, this Court had held that Clause 162B and 162C are to be read
conjointly and a conjoint reading of the same will go to show that there is a provision
for appeal against an order of appointment/suspension/dismissal of a Gaonburah. A
review petition also lies under Clause 162B of the Executive Instructions against an
order of appointment, suspension and dismissal of a Gaonburah before the State

Government.

13. A perusal of the judgment in Mahbubur Rahman (supra) further goes to show
that the writ petition was not dismissed on the ground that it was not maintainable on

account of alternative remedy.

14. In Ram & Shyam Company vs. State of Haryana & ors, reported in (1985) 3 SCC
267, the Supreme Court had stated that the Court had imposed a restraint in its own
wisdom on its exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution where party

Invoking the jurisdiction has an effective adequate alternative remedy. It is expressly

WP(C) 1375/2014
stated therein that the rule which requires the exercise of an alternative remedy is a

rule of convenience and discretion rather than rule of law.

15. In the instant case, having noticed the order dated 12.3.2014, | am of the
considered opinion that it will be wholly inequitable to relegate the petitioner at this
distance of time to seek alternative remedy and therefore, the argument advanced by
Mr. Matin and Mr. Ali for dismissal of the writ petition on the ground of availability of

alternative remedy is repelled.

16. Clause 162A of the Executive Instruction of the Regulation of 1886 lays down
that in the matter of appointment of Gaonburah, the following factors shall be taken
into consideration:

1. Claims of the family members of the Gaonburah;

2. Views of the Mouzadar;

3. Suitability of the person for the post.

17. In Promode Chandra Roy (supra), this Court found that the claims of the family
members of the Gaonburah and the view of the Mouzadar were not taken into
consideration at all and, thus, relevant considerations under Clause 162A of the
Executive Instructions having not been taken into account, this Court had set aside the
order of appointment made in favour of the selected candidate and had remitted the
matter for fresh consideration limiting the exercise to the persons who had responded

to the advertisement in question.

18. A perusal of the Compilation-sheet of oral test held for appointment to the post
of Gaonburah at page 227 of the records produced by Mr. Tai goes to show that, in all,
30 marks were assigned on three components: (i) Education, (Ii) General Knowledge

and (lil) Experience, and 10 marks were allotted to each of the components.

19. It appears that Additional Deputy Commissioner |n-charge, Gaonburah Branch,
Sub-Divisional Officer (Sadar), Gaonburah Branch and Circle Officer, Gaonburah Branch
were the members of the Selection Board. Having regard to the contents of the oral
Interview and allotment of marks, there can be no manner of doubt that the oral
Interview component was conducted _ to find out the suitability of the candidates for

the post and the respondent No. 5 had secured highest marks in such exercise.

20. Though in the affidavit of the respondent Nos. 1 to 4, averments are made to
project a picture that due consideration of relevant materials had taken place, records,

however, do not reveal that there was any consideration by the appointing authority

WP(C) 1375/2014
with regard to the two factors, namely, the claims of the family of the Gaonburah and
views of the Mouzadar as required under Clause 162A of the Executive Instruction
though there are materials on record in that regard. It is not for the writ Court to
evaluate comparative merit of the candidates, vis-a-vis the aforesaid two components. |
am unable to subscribe to the submission of the learned counsel for the respondent No.
5 that the writ petition raises any disputed question of fact. No disputed question of
fact has arisen in the instant case. The Court is only required to examine the decision

making process.

21. As two relevant considerations as ordained under Clause 162A of the Executive
Instructions of Regulation of 1886 for appointment of Gaonburah had not been taken
Into consideration, | am of the considered opinion that selection and appointment of

respondent No. 5 cannot be sustained in law.

22. Taking that view, this writ petition is allowed and the matter is remitted to the
competent authority for fresh consideration of the case of the petitioner, respondent
No. 5 and the other candidate who had submitted candidature, on the basis of
materials available on record which is produced by Mr. Tai, and to pass appropriate
order selecting and appointing one among them as the Gaonburah. Such exercise shall
be completed within a period of four months from the date of receipt of a certified copy
of this order. As respondent No. 5 has been functioning as Gaonburah for a period of
about four years, notwithstanding setting aside of his order of appointment, he will be

allowed to continue for the aforesaid period of four months.

23. No cost.

(Gaonburah Branch), Nagaon, whereby the respondent No. 5 was appointed as the
Gaonburah of Gerajai Pam Lot/Kisamat, under Gerubat Mouza, in the District of

4. The allegations made in the writ petition are that after the interview was held,
without declaring the result and without publishing the select list, appointment order

entertained on 12.3.2014 and direction was issued to the learned State counsel for
production of records and it was also recorded therein that an endeavour will be made

was incumbent on the part of the respondents to have considered such representation.
Even otherwise, wishes of the family of the Gaonburah in terms of Section 162A of the
1886 Regulation is a consideration which cannot be wished away. It is also submitted
that the view of the Mouzadar was not taken into consideration before selection of

respondent No. 5 was made. Ms Kalita has placed reliance on the decision rendered in

WP(C) 1375/2014
the case of Promode Chanatra Roy vs. State of Assam & ors., reported in 2006 (2) GLT
604.

9, By placing reliance on the case of Mahbubur Rahman vs. State of Assam and
Ors., reported in 2005 (4) GLT 397, Mr. Matin and Mr. Ali have submitted that in view
of availability of alternative remedy, the writ petition ought to be dismissed. Mr. Ali has
submitted that the decision rendered in the case of Promode Chandra Roy (supra) will

with regard to the selection and appointment of respondent No. 5.

11. | have considered the submissions of the learned counsel for the parties and

have perused the records of the case as well as the records produced by Mr. Tai.

12. In Mahbubur Rahman (supra), taking note of the provisions contained in the
Regulation of 1886, this Court had held that Clause 162B and 162C are to be read
conjointly and a conjoint reading of the same will go to show that there is a provision
for appeal against an order of appointment/suspension/dismissal of a Gaonburah. A
review petition also lies under Clause 162B of the Executive Instructions against an
order of appointment, suspension and dismissal of a Gaonburah before the State

Government.

13. A perusal of the judgment in Mahbubur Rahman (supra) further goes to show
that the writ petition was not dismissed on the ground that it was not maintainable on

account of alternative remedy.

14. In Ram & Shyam Company vs. State of Haryana & ors, reported in (1985) 3 SCC
267, the Supreme Court had stated that the Court had imposed a restraint in its own
wisdom on its exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution where party

Mr. Matin and Mr. Ali for dismissal of the writ petition on the ground of availability of

16. Clause 162A of the Executive Instruction of the Regulation of 1886 lays down
that in the matter of appointment of Gaonburah, the following factors shall be taken
into consideration:

1. Claims of the family members of the Gaonburah;

2. Views of the Mouzadar;

3. Suitability of the person for the post.

17. In Promode Chandra Roy (supra), this Court found that the claims of the family
members of the Gaonburah and the view of the Mouzadar were not taken into
consideration at all and, thus, relevant considerations under Clause 162A of the
Executive Instructions having not been taken into account, this Court had set aside the
order of appointment made in favour of the selected candidate and had remitted the
matter for fresh consideration limiting the exercise to the persons who had responded

to the advertisement in question.

18. A perusal of the Compilation-sheet of oral test held for appointment to the post
of Gaonburah at page 227 of the records produced by Mr. Tai goes to show that, in all,
30 marks were assigned on three components: (i) Education, (Ii) General Knowledge

and (lil) Experience, and 10 marks were allotted to each of the components.

19. It appears that Additional Deputy Commissioner |n-charge, Gaonburah Branch,
Sub-Divisional Officer (Sadar), Gaonburah Branch and Circle Officer, Gaonburah Branch
were the members of the Selection Board. Having regard to the contents of the oral
Interview and allotment of marks, there can be no manner of doubt that the oral
Interview component was conducted _ to find out the suitability of the candidates for

the post and the respondent No. 5 had secured highest marks in such exercise.

20. Though in the affidavit of the respondent Nos. 1 to 4, averments are made to
project a picture that due consideration of relevant materials had taken place, records,

however, do not reveal that there was any consideration by the appointing authority

WP(C) 1375/2014
with regard to the two factors, namely, the claims of the family of the Gaonburah and
views of the Mouzadar as required under Clause 162A of the Executive Instruction
though there are materials on record in that regard. It is not for the writ Court to
evaluate comparative merit of the candidates, vis-a-vis the aforesaid two components. |
am unable to subscribe to the submission of the learned counsel for the respondent No.
5 that the writ petition raises any disputed question of fact. No disputed question of
fact has arisen in the instant case. The Court is only required to examine the decision

making process.

21. As two relevant considerations as ordained under Clause 162A of the Executive
Instructions of Regulation of 1886 for appointment of Gaonburah had not been taken
Into consideration, | am of the considered opinion that selection and appointment of

respondent No. 5 cannot be sustained in law.

22. Taking that view, this writ petition is allowed and the matter is remitted to the
competent authority for fresh consideration of the case of the petitioner, respondent
No. 5 and the other candidate who had submitted candidature, on the basis of
materials available on record which is produced by Mr. Tai, and to pass appropriate
order selecting and appointing one among them as the Gaonburah. Such exercise shall
be completed within a period of four months from the date of receipt of a certified copy
of this order. As respondent No. 5 has been functioning as Gaonburah for a period of
about four years, notwithstanding setting aside of his order of appointment, he will be

allowed to continue for the aforesaid period of four months.

23. No cost.

For respondent No. Child Development Project Officer,
Raha ICDS Project, Raha,
District-Nagaon, Assam. Minu Devi Saikia in this writ petition is that the selection
of respondent No. The petitioner prays for setting aside the letter dated 21.11.2014, issued by the
Director of Social Welfare Department directing the CDPO, Raha | CDS Project to hold a fresh
interview for appointment of Anganwadi Worker for the Anganwadi Centre in question and
for a direction to appoint her as Anganwadi Worker in the Anganwadi Centre in question as

she is a resident of Ward No. However, by an order dated 21.11.2014, the Director of Social
Welfare Department, Assam, directed the CDPO, Raha to conduct a fresh interview inviting
applications from the candidates of the concerned wards only, as published in the
advertisement dated 31.05.2013. On the other hand, the name of Sewali Bora (writ petitioner)
has not been seen in the list of eligible canaidates for the post of Mini AWW which
was published on I* July, 2013. It is pertinent to mention
herein that submission of enguiry§ reoort vwde communication no. DPO(NJE/I4G/97/2197 dated 8.4.2014 speaks about Petboha Veterinary Khanda
AWC which is quoted below:

as per advertisement which AWC Is situated at ward no. n the survey register it is seen that majority of population
covers in the ward no. The
residence of Puball Saikia, Sewall Bora are in the survey area. The Gaonbura
of Uttar Petboha stated that these 2 candidates appeared in the interview are
from ward no. 6 stated that the reoort
regarding candidates appeared in the interview Board. In the affidavit filed on 03.11.2014 by the CDPO, Raha, in WP(C) 1614/2014, it is
stated at paragraph 7 that Sewali Bora, i.e., the petitioner in WP(C) 6768/2014, and Minu
Devi Saikia, |.e., As per advertisement

It is Clear that the candidates from ward no. Application received from outside the centre
area shall be rejected immediately.” 5, including that of Pubali Saikia and Sewali
Bora, are in the surveyed area of the Anganwadi Centre in question. 6, no occasion had really arisen for them to approach this
Court against the said advertisement because their candidature had been accepted. Annexure M(1) of the affidavit-in-reply filed by Sewali Bora negates the claim made by the

CDPO, Raha, that her name was not in the list of the eligible candidates. The order reflects non-application of mind and non-consideration of relevant

materials. If,
however, it is found that the petitioner in WP(C) 6768/2014 is not meeting the residential
eligibility qualification but the petitioner in WP(C) 6749/2014 fulfills Clause 3 of the
advertisement, she will be engaged as Anganwadi Worker in respect of the centre in
question. JUDGE

|] UDGEMENT AND ORDER

Heard Mr. B. K. Das, learned counsel appearing for the writ petitioner in WP(C)
1614/2014, Mr. R. Hazarika, learned counsel for the writ petitioner in WP(C) 6749/2014,
who is alSo appearing for respondent No. 6 in WP(C) 1614/2014 as well as Mr. S. K. Singha,
learned counsel appearing for the writ petitioner in WP(C) 6768/2014, who is also appearing
for respondent No. 5 in WP(C) 1614/2014 and respondent No. 6 in WP(C) 6749/2014. Also
heard Ms. M. Bhattachrjee, learned State counsel, appearing for respondent Nos. 1 to 4 in
WP(C) 1614/2014, respondent Nos. 1 to 5 in WP(C) 6749/2014 and respondent Nos. 1 to 3
in WP(C) 6768/2014.

2. The three writ petitions, namely, WP(C) 1614/2014, filed by Smt. Pubali Saikia,
WP(C) 6749/2014, filed by Smt. Minu Devi Saikia and WP(C) 6768/2014, filed by Smt.
Sewali Bora relate to appointment of Anganwadi Worker in respect of Petboha Veterinery
Khanda Mini Anganwadi Centre, under Raha |CDS Project, Nagaon. In WP(C) 1614/2014,
Sewali Bora and Minu Devi Saikia are arrayed as respondent Nos. 5 and 6, respectively. In
WP(C) 6749/2014, Sewali Bora is arrayed as respondent No. 6 and in WP(C) 6768/2014

neither Pubali Saikia nor Minu Devi Saikia are party-respondents.

3. The petitioners in all the three writ petitions had responded to an advertisement
dated 31.05.2013, issued by Child Development Project Officer (CDPO), Raha ICDS Project,
Raha for appointment of Anganwadi Workers and Anganwadi Helpers for various Anganwadi
Centres under Raha ICDS Project including Petboha Veterinery Khanda Mini Anganwadi
Centre. At the outset, the basic case as projected in each of the writ petitions may be noted,

which is as under:

(A) WP(C) 1614/ 2014

The case of the petitioner, Pubali Saikia is that though in the select list published on
06.08.2013 the name of Smt. Sewali Bora was shown at SI. No. 1 with 31.66% marks and
that of Smt. Minu Devi Saikia at SI. No. 2 with 30.00% marks, they are not residents of the

WP(C) 1614/2014 with WP(C) 6749/2014
With WP(C) 6768/2014
local limit of the Anganwadi Centre in question and, therefore, they were not entitled to be
selected for appointment for the Anganwadi Centre in question. In the select list in question,
the petitioner was shown in the third position with 28.66% marks. By filing the writ petition,
the petitioner prays for a direction to appoint the petitioner as Anganwadi Worker in respect

of the Anganwadi Centre in question.

(B) WP(C) 6749/ 2014

The case projected by Smt. Minu Devi Saikia in this writ petition is that the selection
of respondent No. 6, i.e., Sewali Bora [petitioner in WP(C) 6768/2014] is bad in law as the
respondent No. 6 is not a resident of Ward No. 6, t.e., within the limit of the Anganwadi
Centre. The petitioner prays for setting aside the letter dated 21.11.2014, issued by the
Director of Social Welfare Department directing the CDPO, Raha | CDS Project to hold a fresh
interview for appointment of Anganwadi Worker for the Anganwadi Centre in question and
for a direction to appoint her as Anganwadi Worker in the Anganwadi Centre in question as

she is a resident of Ward No. 6 and she had secured second position in the select list.

(C) WP(C) 6768/ 2014

The petitioner, Sewali Bora, applied for the said post and appeared in the interview
that was held on 06.07.2013. Select list was published on 06.08.2013 showing the petitioner
at 1* position with 31.66% marks to be selected as Anganwadi Worker in respect of the said
Anganwadi Centre. As no engagement letter was issued to the petitioner pursuant to the
Said selection, the petitioner filed a writ petition, being WP(C) 2559/2014, which was
disposed of by this Court on 05.11.2014 directing the Director of Social Welfare Department,
Assam, to do the needful in respect of the aforesaid select list as expeditiously as possible,
preferably within 30.11.2014. However, by an order dated 21.11.2014, the Director of Social
Welfare Department, Assam, directed the CDPO, Raha to conduct a fresh interview inviting
applications from the candidates of the concerned wards only, as published in the
advertisement dated 31.05.2013. The instant writ application is filed for quashing of the
aforesaid letter dated 21.11.2014.

4. In all, three affidavits, one each in each of the three writ petitions had been filed by
the CDPO, Raha.

5. In the affidavit filed by the CDPO, Raha (respondent No. 3) on 27.04.2015 in WP(C)
6768/2014, it is stated at paragraph 5 as follows:

WP(C) 1614/2014 with WP(C) 6749/2014
With WP(C) 6768/2014
“(5) That with regard to the statements made in paragraph 5, 6 and 7 of the
wrt petition, the deoonent begs to state that as per advertisement, the surveyed
area of Petboha Veterinary Khanda is at Ward No. 6 though covering few families
from the Ward No. 5. On the other hand, the name of Sewali Bora (writ petitioner)
has not been seen in the list of eligible canaidates for the post of Mini AWW which
was published on I* July, 2013. It is known that the wnt petitioner, Sewali Bora and
the candidate, Smt. Pubali Saikia are not belong to Ward No. 6 according to Ward
member of Ward No. 6 and Gaonbura of Uttar Petboha. It is pertinent to mention
herein that submission of enguiry§ reoort vwde communication no.
DPO(NJE/I4G/97/2197 dated 8.4.2014 speaks about Petboha Veterinary Khanda
AWC which is quoted below:

as per advertisement which AWC Is situated at ward no. 6 of Petboha
Revenue Village. [n the survey register it is seen that majority of population
covers in the ward no. 6 and few families are included from ward no. 5. The
residence of Puball Saikia, Sewall Bora are in the survey area. The Gaonbura
of Uttar Petboha stated that these 2 candidates appeared in the interview are
from ward no. 5. And the rest of candidates are from ward no. 6. Now the
centre is still running in ward no. 6 by Smt. Rita Saikia old helper of No. 1
Uttar Petboha AWC: The ward member of ward No. 6 stated that the reoort
regarding candidates appeared in the interview Board. As per advertisement
It is Gear that the candidates from ward no. 6 should be preferable for
selection of AWW of the said! AWC: ’

Copy of the list of eligible candidates and communication
dated 84,2014 are annexed herewith and marked as Annexure-1 and

2 respectively.”

6. In the affidavit filed on 03.11.2014 by the CDPO, Raha, in WP(C) 1614/2014, it is
stated at paragraph 7 that Sewali Bora, i.e., the petitioner in WP(C) 6768/2014, and Minu
Devi Saikia, |.e., the petitioner in WP(C) 6749/2014 are residents within the Anganwadi

Centre area. In the paragraph 7 of the said affidavit, it is stated as follows:

“7) That with regard to the statements made in paragraoh 7 of the writ
petition, the deoonent begs to state that it is not understood as to why the
President, Gahi GP and Ward Member, GP issued certificate stating that resoondent

No. 5 & 6 Is not situated within the local limit of AWC in question inasmuch as the

WP(C) 1614/2014 with WP(C) 6749/2014
With WP(C) 6768/2014
7.

Gaonbura of village Uttar Patboha has already Issued residential certificate which
was available with the application forms of respondent No. 5 & 6 submitted pursuant
to advertisement dated 31.5.2013 certifying that respondent No. 5 & 6 reside at
Vilage Uttar Patboha and it Is apparent that the residential certificate dated
14,03.2014 & 11.03.2014 (annexure 6 & 7 at page 18 and 20 to the wnt petition)
was Issued subsequent to advertisement as the last date of receiving application was
fixed on 07.06.2013 and the above noted certificate dated 14.03.2014 and
11.03.2014 is not available in the office. And as such, the ground based on the
above certificate dated 14.03.2014 and 11.03.2014 (annexure 6 & 7 at page 18 and
20 to the writ petition) should not be taken into account and the whole statement Is

baseless. ”

In the affidavit filed by the CDPO, Raha, filed on 14.05.2015 in WP(C) 6749/2014, it

IS Stated at paragraph 4 as follows:

“(4) That the deoonent begs to state that as per advertisement, the surveyed
area of Petboha Veterinary Khanda Is at Ward No. 6 though covering few families
from the Ward No. 5. On the other hand, the narne of Sewalt Bora (respondent No.
6) has not been seen in the list of eligible canaidates for the post of Mini AWW which
was published on I* July, 2013. It is known that the respondent No. 6, Sewali Bora
and one candidate, Smt. Pubali Saikia are not belong to Ward No. 6 according to
Ward member of Ward No. 6 and Gaonbura of Uttar Petboha. It is pertinent to
mention herein that submission of enquiry reoort vide communication no.
DPO(NJE/I4G/97/2197 dated 84.2014 speaks about Petboha Veterinary Khanda
AWC which Is quoted below:

as per advertisement which AWC Is situated at ward no. 6 of Petboha
Revenue Village. !n the survey register it is seen that majority of population
covers in the ward no. 6 and few families are included from ward no, 5. The
residence of Puball Saikia, Sewall Bora are in the survey area. The Gaonbura
of Uttar Petboha stated that these 2 candidates appeared in the interview are
from ward no. 5. And the rest of candidates are from ward no. 6. Now the
centre Is still running in ward no. 6 by Smt. Rita Saikia old helper of No. 1
Uttar Petboha AWC: The ward member of ward No. 6 stated that the reoort
regarding candidates appeared in the interview Board. As per advertisement

It is Clear that the candidates from ward no. 6 should be preferable for

WP(C) 1614/2014 with WP(C) 6749/2014
With WP(C) 6768/2014
selection of AWW of the said: AWC: It would be pertinent to mention herein
that the writ petitioner obtained 2 position which is crystal clear at

Annexure-D to the instant writ petition’

Communication dated 84.2014 are annexed herewith and

marked as Annexure-1. ”

8. The aforesaid affidavits on behalf of the State respondents were filed by one Dinesh
Chandra Das, who is the CDPO, Raha ICDS Project. From the affidavit filed in WP(C)
6768/2014 and WP(C) 6749/2014, it is seen that stand is taken that as per the
advertisement the survey area of Petboha Veterinary Khanda Mini Angalwadi Centre is at
Ward No. 6 though it also covers a few families from Ward No. 5. According to the Ward
Member of Ward No. 6 and Gaonbura of Uttar Petboha Village, Sewali Bora and Pubali Saikia
do not belong to Ward No. 6. The name of Sewali Bora was not available in the list of
eligible candidates. At the same time, in the affidavit filed in WP(C) 1614/2014, it is stated
that the Gaonbura of Uttar Petboha Village had issued a certificate certifying that Sewali
Bora resides at village Uttar Petboha. The enquiry report, which was quoted in the affidavits
filed in WP(C) 6768/2014 and WP(C) 6749/2014, indicates that the residence of Puballi
Saikia and Sewali Bora are in the surveyed area of the Anganwadi Centre and that they had

appeared in the interview from Ward No. 5.

9. However, in the affidavit-in-reply, Sewali Bora has disputed the assertion made by
the CDPO that her name does not appear in the list of eligible candidates and states that her
name appears at SI. No. 6 in the list of eligible candidates and she has also annexed a

document, as Annexure M(1), to demonstrate the same.

10. Clause 3 of the Advertisement dated 31.05.2013, which Is in vernacular, is relevant.
The translation thereof, as provided by the petitioners in each of the writ petitions, reads as
follows:
WP(C) 1614/2014
‘3. The applicant must be a resident of the locality of the particular
Revenue village where the centre is located and she should be annexed
certificate Issued and sign by Gaonbura/Ward Member. Application of the
outsider of the Centre shall be rejected.”
WP(C) 67492014
‘8. Applicant must be a permanent resident of the area of Anganwaal

Centre against which they are applying for, certificate from Gaonbura or

WP(C) 1614/2014 with WP(C) 6749/2014
With WP(C) 6768/2014
Ward Member has to be enclosed with the application. Applications from
outside the area centre will be summarily rejected.”
WP(C) 6768/2014

‘3. The candidate should be a local resident of the approved centre
area. A certificate signed by local Gaonburha or Ward Member should be
enclosed with the application. Application received from outside the centre
area shall be rejected immediately.”

11. The advertisement in respect of the Anganwadi Centre in question has indicated
Ward No. 6 as the surveyed area of the Anganwadi Centre. There is no uniformity in
translation of Clause 3 of the advertisement in all the three writ petitions. However, it
appears there from that Clause 3 requires a candidate to be a permanent resident of the
notified/surveyed area of the Anganwadi Centre in question. It appears that there are two
other Anganwadi Centres in Ward No. 5, three Anganwadi Centres in Ward No. 3 and three
Anganwadi Centres in Ward No. 9.

12. Though the advertisement specifies that the area of the Anganwadi Centre in
question is Ward No. 6, from the enquiry report it appears that the Survey Register reveals
that residences of a few families of Ward No. 5, including that of Pubali Saikia and Sewali
Bora, are in the surveyed area of the Anganwadi Centre in question. It is also evident that
despite the undisputed fact that Sewali Bora and Pubali Saikia are residents of Ward No. 5,
they had been allowed to participate in the interview. Pubali Saikia, on the other hand, had
alleged that Sewali Bora and Minu Devi Saikia are residents beyond the area of the

Anganwadi Centre.

13. It is evident from the pleadings in WP(C) 1614/2014 and WP(C) 6749/2014 that the
petitioners have not questioned their position in the select list. At the cost of repetition, it is
to be noted that Sewali Bora [petitioner in WP(C) 6768/2014], Minu Devi Saikia [petitioner in
WP(C) 6749/2014] and Pubali Saikia [petitioner in WP(C) 1614/2014] were placed at Sl.
Nos. 1, 2 and 3, respectively in the select list.

14. If the surveyed area of the Anganwadi Centre in question includes some residents of
Ward No. 5, apart from the residents of Ward No. 6, it will be unjustified and unreasonable
to exclude such residents of Ward No. 5 from participating in the selection process held in
respect of the Anganwadi Centre. It is also not understood why in that case the
advertisement mentioned only Ward No. 6. Though a question can be posed that Sewali

Bora and Pubali Saikia had not challenged the advertisement wherein the Anganwadi Centre

WP(C) 1614/2014 with WP(C) 6749/2014
With WP(C) 6768/2014
area is shown to be Ward No. 6, no occasion had really arisen for them to approach this
Court against the said advertisement because their candidature had been accepted.
Annexure M(1) of the affidavit-in-reply filed by Sewali Bora negates the claim made by the

CDPO, Raha, that her name was not in the list of the eligible candidates.

15. By the order dated 21.11.2014, without assigning any reason, the Director of Social
Welfare, directed the CDPO, Raha, to conduct a fresh interview inviting applications from the
candidates of the concerned ward only, as published in the advertisement dated 31.05.2013.
The order also does not advert to the enquiry report which has been referred to in the
affidavits. The order reflects non-application of mind and non-consideration of relevant

materials.

16. In view of the above discussions, the order dated 21.11.2014 is set aside and
quashed. The Director of Social Welfare is directed to ascertain, on the basis of relevant
materials as to what is the surveyed area that falls within the Anganwadi Centre and to

2. The core issued involved in this writ petition is as to whether the land
measuring 8 bighas 3 kathas 10 lechas of Dag No.401 of KP Patta No.60 of
village Bihdia, Mouza Chaygaon Pantan, 4 bighas 1 katha 4 lechas covered by
Dag No.707 of KP Patta No.348 of village Makali Mouza Chaygaon Pantan and
4 bighas 4 kathas 10 lechas covered by Dag No.560 of KP Patta No.126 of
village Naopara, Mouza Chaygaon Pantan belongs to the writ petitioners or it

belongs to the respondent temple authorities.

3. From the Jamabandi, it is noted that the land originally belongs to
Chaturbhuj Thakur @ Chaturbhuj Bora, but the question as to whether said
Chaturbhuj Thakur was a living person being the predecessor-in-interest of
the petitioners or Chaturbhuj Thakur was a deity of the concerned temple is
not clear. Without adjudicating the aforesaid question no further legal right of

the respective parties can be determined.

4. On one hand, the petitioners claim that Chaturbhuj Thakur @
Chaturbhuj Bora was the predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners, who was
the original owner of the land and on the other hand, the respondent temple

authorities claim that Chaturbhuj Thakur is the governing deity of the temple.

5. — It is noticed that in the order dated 25.04.2002 of the Circle Officer in
Mutation Case No.16/2000-2001, a finding had been arrived at by stating that
after considering all aspects, the Circle Officer is satisfied that the disputed

the petitioners or it was Chaturbhuj Thakur being a deity of the temple.

7. In such view of the matter, as agreed to by the learned counsel for the

concerned Circle Officer to conduct a hearing by giving opportunity to both
the petitioners and the temple authorities and also by allowing both the

parties to produce all relevant materials that the petitioners as well as the

to whether the land, in question, originally belongs to the predecessor-in
Interest of the petitioners or it belongs to the temple authorities.

aforesaid exercise shall prevail over all orders of the Circle Officer and the
orders of the learned Board of Revenue in RA No.46/2001-2002, 47/20012002 and 48/2001-2002 as well as in Case No.32RA(K)/2007, Case

For the Petitioner : Ms. P Bhattacharjee, Advocate. However, since the materials were not
Supposed to be available at the place where it was found without proper
authorization, the petitioner upon being instructed, submitted an FIR by
incorporating the total value of the materials that was found with an
estimate of Rs,3,54, 000/-. Pursuant to the FIR, a criminal case under section 409/411 of

the IPC was registered under the Nagaon Police Station Case No.978 of

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 2 of 16
2007 and investigation was made by the assigned police officer. Consequently, the Investigation Officer submitted the Final Report and the
learned Chief Judicial Magistrate of Nagaon issued summon to the
petitioner directing him to appear before the Court on 30.9.2008 for
raising objections against the Final Report of the Investigation Officer if
any. Thereafter vide order dated 30.9.2008, the learned G/M discharged the

respondent No. It was stated that the
order of discharge in favour of the respondent No.4 dated 30.9.2008 was
a result of the no-objection submitted by the petitioner against the Final
report of the Investigation Officer although the petitioner himself had
lodged the FIR. Against the show cause notice, the petitioner submitted his
reply on 13.12.2008 denying the allegation made against him and that he
had not violated the Regulation-10(1) as alleged. He stated that there was

nothing wrong in the submission of the no-objection against the Final

WP (C) No. He submits that the allegations were only

misconceived and he was being victimized. The respondent authorities not being satisfied with the reply of
the petitioner to the show cause notice, issued a charge sheet on
21.4.2009 (Annexure-7) whereby two charges were drawn against the
petitioner i.e. negligence of duty and breach of the ASEB Office
(Conduct)Regulations, 1982. Petitioner was asked to submit his statement

of defense within 10 days from the date of receipt of the communication. Regulation-10(1) as provided in the statement of allegation of the
charge sheet may be reproduced for reference:
Regulation-10(1) and the Regulation 3(1)

“Regulation-10(1): Every Officer of the Board shall
discharge the duties assigned to him with integrity, loyalty and
promptitute and carryout all lawful orders of his superiors in respect of the
duties assigned to him’. “Regulation-3(1):EveryOfticer of the Boara/Company
Shall at all times (i) maintain absolute integrity (i!) maintain devotion to
duty (il) do nothing which Is unbecoming of an Officer of the

Board/Company”. Along with the
Charge sheet, a list of documents as well as list of witnesses were also

provided under the heading ‘Annexure-1’. The petitioner against the charge sheet submitted his reply on
4.5.2009 (Annexure-8) denying the charge made out against him. He also stated that the application submitted by him
before the Court were not the basis of the order dated 30.9.2008 passed
by the learned CJM discharging the respondent No.4. He

therefore prayed that the charges be dropped against him. The respondents nevertheless proceeded with the enquiry by
appointing an Enquiry Officer for the purpose. The Enquiry Officer
found that although the petitioner in his written statements contended
that his deposition during the departmental enquiry made against the
respondent No. 4 were based on materials available in the official records
and not on his personal knowledge, were in fact not substantiated by him
to show as to what records he was referring to. Moreover, the
petitioner before filing the petition before the Court should have consulted
his superior i.e. the Deputy General Manager. Thus, the charge of
negligence was proved and on that count the charge No.2 also stood
proved to the extent it was proved against charge No.1. The petitioner by the same
communication was asked to be present for personal hearing on
28.10.2009 at the designated office chamber given in the notice. Although
the petitioner filed his reply to the second show cause notice dated
8.10.2009 before the Managing Director on 28.10.2009, the Chairman

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 6 of 16
Director of APDCL nevertheless passed the impugned order dated
29.10.2009 (Annexure-12) imposing upon the petitioner a penalty of

withholding one increment with cumulative effect. However,
the Board vide its decision taken in the 34 Board meeting held on
10.12.2010, rejected the appeal of the petitioner and upheld the penalty
imposed upon the petitioner. Appearing for the petitioner, Ms. P Bhattacharjee, the learned
counsel submits that the imposition of the penalty by withholding one
increment with cumulative effect and also the manner in which the
departmental proceeding was drawn up against the petitioner is
unsustainable under the given facts and circumstances. She submits that
the petitioner prior to filing of the FIR duly informed his superiors and it
was as per their instruction that he had filed the FIR on 20.12.2007. She
Submits that the investigation was carried out by the police authorities
pursuant to the filing of the FIR and thereafter the Final Report submitted
before the Court. That by itself cannot be the ground to proceed with the
petitioner departmentally since the petitioner had not committed any
wrong. She submits that the acceptance of the petitioner with regard to

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 7 of 16
the Final Report cannot therefore have any bearing in the order to be
passed by the learned CJ] M. She submits that the CJM by considering the
materials available pursuant to the investigation done by the Investigation
Officer found no prima facie case against the respondent No.4 and
accordingly discharged him from the case. Therefore, the petitioner on the
said premises could not have been proceeded with by the respondent

authorities by charging him for violating the Regulation. Ms. P Bhattacharjee further submits that the respondent
authorities are very well aware of their rights. If they were not satisfied
with the discharge of the respondent No.4, they are not prevented from
filing appeal or otherwise against the order of discharge. The said
procedure was not adopted by the respondent authorities and instead the
petitioner has been made the scapegoat. She also draws the attention of
the Court to the order dated 4.8.2008 by which the respondent No.4 was
proceeded with departmentally and as a result his pay was reduced by
one increment in the existing time scale with immediate effect. She submits that although the
seized materials were taken back from the custody of the Court but no
one has come forth to claim the said materials. She therefore

Submits that as there is none to claim the said materials, the question of

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 8 of 16
implicating the petitioner and thereafter imposing upon him the impugned

penalty is not justified and unsustainable. Ms. P Bhattacharjee also submits
that the punishment of withholding one increment with cumulative effect
aS was imposed upon the petitioner vide order dated 29.10.2009 Is not
provided for in the Regulation and therefore the petitioner could not have
been imposed with such a penalty. The Regulation clearly provides that
the stoppage of increment has to be for a specified period. She therefore
Submits that even on this count, the imposed penalty upon the petitioner

IS not sustainable. Mr.
S Chakraborthy submits that when the discovery was made by the
petitioner with regard to the materials which were unauthorizedly found at

the proposed BTS site of the BSNL, the petitioner on instruction was asked

WP (C) No. While such was the stand of the petitioner in the FIR as well as in the
departmental enquiry initiated against the respondent No. 4, the petitioner
on 30.9.2008 submitted his no objection in writing before the CM,
Nagaon stating that he had no objection against the report submitted by
the police in connection with the Nagaon Police Station Case No.978 of
2007 and thereby resulting in the discharge of the respondent No.4. Therefore, the stand of the petitioner being most contradictory, the
respondent authorities found a prima facie case against him for his
doubtful integrity and unreliable behavior against the interest of the
company attracting Regulation 10(1) of the Regulation. The petitioner’s
reply to the show cause notice not being found satisfactory, a detailed
departmental proceeding was drawn up against him which resulted with

the finding that the charge against the petitioner to be proved. 2948 of 2011 Page 10 of 16
respondent authorities and therefore, the complaint was made on behalf
of the respondents Company. However, the petitioner without consulting
his superiors proceeded to file his no-objection against the Final Report of
the Investigation Officer which resulted in the discharge of the respondent
No.4. Such action/inaction on the part of the writ petitioner is most
unprecedented and against the interest of the company while he being
one of the employee himself. Thereafter, upon consideration
of the reply given by the petitioner, the disciplinary authority decided to
impose the penalty of stoppage of one increment with cumulative effect. The appeal of the petitioner was also duly considered by the Board and
after taking into account that all the procedures and formalities had been
duly applied before imposition of penalty, the Board found that there was
no ground to interfere with the findings and quantum of the penalty

imposed upon the petitioner and thus upheld the impugned order of

penalty. Mr. S Chakraborhty further submits that unless there is
irregularity committed during the enquiry proceedings or that the findings
of the enquiry officer is perverse and not based on relevant materials,
Court would not interfere with such proceedings and also on the penalty

consequently imposed upon the delinquent officer. The charge clearly being
established, there is no scope for drawing up of corollary with the
proceedings against the respondent No.4. He thus submits that under the
facts and circumstances, the writ petition being without merit should be

dismissed. | have heard the learned counsel for the rival parties and |
have perused the materials available on record. Mr. S Chakraborhty has
also produced the relevant records pertaining to the departmental
proceedings and | have also perused the same. The materials which were found at the
site was claimed by the respondent No. 4 as ABADRP materials and that
he was the recipient of the same. 4 and discharged him from the liability vide order

dated 30.9.2008. The role of the petitioner in the process was his filing of

WP (C) No. On perusal of the records produced by Mr. S chakraborhty,
it can be seen that the petitioner had informed the Senior Manager,
Nagaon Electrical Division -| Nagaon on 19.12.2007 that the materials
which were found at the site were of the approximate value of Rs.3,
54,000/- and respondent No.4 apparently was responsible for diverting the
materials and thereby confirmed his involvement in the matter with the ill
motive. 2948 of 2011 Page 13 of 16
perversity, in my considered view is not to be found. Regulation 10(8)
and Regulation 10(9) provides that the officer may prefer an appeal
against the order of penalty/penalties specified in the Regulation within a
period of two months from the date of receipt of the order by which the
appellant is aggrieved and thereafter the appeal is to be considered by the
Board on certain parameter including the justification of the findings the
excessiveness of the penalty and Its adequateness etc. Thereafter, the
Board may set aside, reduce, confirm or enhance the penalty or even
remit the case back to the authority for imposition of such penalty as it
may deem fit . A perusal of the said provision clearly indicates that some
responsibilities is cast upon the appellate authority to consider the appeal
before it. In the instant case, the appellate authority i.e. the Board in Its
34"". Board meeting held on 10.12.2010 apparently appears to have
Summarily considered the appeal of the petitioner while rejecting the

same. 2948 of 2011 Page 14 of 16
proceeding altogether was imposed with the penalty of reduction of pay
by one increment in the existing time scale. The said penalty was
Subsequently restricted or made effective for a period of one year only. Therefore, it can be seen that the respondent authorities are aware of the
fact that if the penalty of increment is to be withheld, the duration of the

penalty is to be specified in terms of the Regulation aforementioned. The role of the Court as well as the extent to which it is
required to travel while examining the process of departmental
proceedings is well settled. The role of the Court is mainly confined to
examining the decision making process and not the decision itself. It is submitted at the bar
that the petitioner has since retired from service from the post of SubDivisional Engineer while posted at Nagaon on 31.8.2015. The decision of the
Board shall be communicated to the petitioner. In the
result, the decision of the Board dismissing the appeal of the petitioner
vide its 34 meeting minutes dated 10.12.2010 is hereby interfered with. 2948 of 2011 Page 16 of 16

Heard Ms. P Bhattacharjee, the learned counsel for the
petitioner and Mr. S Chakraborthy, Standing Counsel, Assam Power
Distribution Company Ltd. (APDCL). None appears for the respondent

No.4 despite notice.

2. Brief facts of the case may be narrated at the outset. The
petitioner who was working as Deputy Manager at Kaliabor Electrical SubDivision, Nagaon under the APDCL at the relevant time on 20.12.2007
(Annexure-1) submitted an FIR before the Officer-in-Charge of the
Haiborgaon Police outpost in the district of Nagaon to the effect that on
15.12.2007 during his visit to the proposed BTS site of BSNL, Mullapattay,
Nagaon, he noticed three labourers brining some Conductor from a
Conductor Drum and on upon making a query he was informed that one
Sri Dhruva Lal Dey (Respondent No.4), , FME, NESD-III| gave them
instructions for bringing the conductor to that place. Respondent No.4
soon after arrived on the spot and claimed that the materials were APDRP
materials and he was the recipient. However, since the materials were not
Supposed to be available at the place where it was found without proper
authorization, the petitioner upon being instructed, submitted an FIR by
incorporating the total value of the materials that was found with an
estimate of Rs,3,54, 000/-.

3. Pursuant to the FIR, a criminal case under section 409/411 of

the IPC was registered under the Nagaon Police Station Case No.978 of

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 2 of 16
2007 and investigation was made by the assigned police officer.
Consequently, the Investigation Officer submitted the Final Report and the
learned Chief Judicial Magistrate of Nagaon issued summon to the
petitioner directing him to appear before the Court on 30.9.2008 for
raising objections against the Final Report of the Investigation Officer if
any. On 30.9.2008, the petitioner appeared before the Court and
Submitted his no-objection to the Final Report of the Investigation Officer.
Thereafter vide order dated 30.9.2008, the learned G/M discharged the

respondent No. 4 from the police case registered against him.

4. Thereafter on 3.12.2008(Annexure-5), the respondent No.3
issued a show cause notice to the petitioner requiring him to show cause
on the allegation that prima facie the petitioner appeared to have doubtful
Integrity and unreliable behavior against the interest of the company
amounting to misconduct under Rule 10 (f) of the ASEB (General Services)
Regulation (for officers), 1960 (The Regulation). It was stated that the
order of discharge in favour of the respondent No.4 dated 30.9.2008 was
a result of the no-objection submitted by the petitioner against the Final
report of the Investigation Officer although the petitioner himself had
lodged the FIR. Furthermore, on 10.4.2008 during the departmental
proceedings drawn up against the respondent No.4, the petitioner had
clearly deposed before the Enquiry Officer of the alleged involvement of

the respondent No.4 for the theft of the materials mentioned in the FIR.

5. Against the show cause notice, the petitioner submitted his
reply on 13.12.2008 denying the allegation made against him and that he
had not violated the Regulation-10(1) as alleged. He stated that there was

nothing wrong in the submission of the no-objection against the Final

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 3 of 16
report submitted by the Investigation Officer in aS much as the
Investigation Officer after making his investigation did not find sufficient
materials to implicate the respondent No.4 and in fact if the establishment
was not satisfied with the discharge of the respondent No.4, appropriate
remedy was available through the relevant provisions of the Code of
Criminal Procedure. He submits that the allegations were only

misconceived and he was being victimized.

6. The respondent authorities not being satisfied with the reply of
the petitioner to the show cause notice, issued a charge sheet on
21.4.2009 (Annexure-7) whereby two charges were drawn against the
petitioner i.e. negligence of duty and breach of the ASEB Office
(Conduct)Regulations, 1982. Petitioner was asked to submit his statement

of defense within 10 days from the date of receipt of the communication.

7. Regulation-10(1) as provided in the statement of allegation of the
charge sheet may be reproduced for reference:
Regulation-10(1) and the Regulation 3(1)

“Regulation-10(1): Every Officer of the Board shall
discharge the duties assigned to him with integrity, loyalty and
promptitute and carryout all lawful orders of his superiors in respect of the
duties assigned to him’.

“Regulation-3(1):EveryOfticer of the Boara/Company
Shall at all times (i) maintain absolute integrity (i!) maintain devotion to
duty (il) do nothing which Is unbecoming of an Officer of the

Board/Company”.

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 4 of 16
8. The charge of negligence of duty was substantiated in the
statements of allegations made against the petitioner aS was
communicated vide show cause notice dated 3.12.2008. Further, as for
the charge No.2 t.e. breach of the Regulation, the petitioner was alleged
to have failed to maintain absolute integrity, devotion to his duty and
acted in a manner which is unbecoming of an Officer of the Board/
Company and thereby clearly a breach of the Regulation. Along with the
Charge sheet, a list of documents as well as list of witnesses were also

provided under the heading ‘Annexure-1’.

9. The petitioner against the charge sheet submitted his reply on
4.5.2009 (Annexure-8) denying the charge made out against him. The
petitioner stated that whatever statement that was made by him during
the departmental enquiry against the respondent No.4 were only based on
the materials available on the official records and not on the basis of his
personal knowledge. He also stated that the application submitted by him
before the Court were not the basis of the order dated 30.9.2008 passed
by the learned CJM discharging the respondent No.4. Therefore, his
application before the Court or the order dated 30.9.2008 not being
furnished to him could not be the basis of the charge made out against
him. He also stated that after the respondent No.4 was discharged and
the Zimanama cancelled, the seized articles were neither claimed by the
Electricity Board nor by the respondent No.4. Therefore, in the absence of
any loss sustained by the Board, the question of the petitioner being
charged with negligence or failure of supervision did not arise. He

therefore prayed that the charges be dropped against him.

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 5 of 16
10. The respondents nevertheless proceeded with the enquiry by
appointing an Enquiry Officer for the purpose. The Enquiry Officer after
completion of the enquiry submitted his report on 28.8.2009 (Annexure-9)
with a finding that the charge against the petitioner in terms of the charge
sheet dated 21.4.2009 were found to be proved. The Enquiry Officer
found that although the petitioner in his written statements contended
that his deposition during the departmental enquiry made against the
respondent No. 4 were based on materials available in the official records
and not on his personal knowledge, were in fact not substantiated by him
to show as to what records he was referring to. The statements of the
petitioner was clearly inconsistent as he had clearly implicated the
respondent No.4 during the departmental enquiry against the respondent
No.4 where he was cited as one of the department witness and he also
clearly mentioned the same in the FIR whereas in the petition filed by him
before the Court he accepted the Final Report made by the Investigation
Officer leading to the discharge of the respondent No.4. Moreover, the
petitioner before filing the petition before the Court should have consulted
his superior i.e. the Deputy General Manager. Thus, the charge of
negligence was proved and on that count the charge No.2 also stood
proved to the extent it was proved against charge No.1. Consequently, the
respondent authorities vide communication dated 8.10.2009 (Annexure10) issued a second show cause notice to the petitioner contemplating the
imposition of a penalty of reduction to a lower stage by withholding five
Increments with cumulative effect. The petitioner by the same
communication was asked to be present for personal hearing on
28.10.2009 at the designated office chamber given in the notice. Although
the petitioner filed his reply to the second show cause notice dated
8.10.2009 before the Managing Director on 28.10.2009, the Chairman

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 6 of 16
Director of APDCL nevertheless passed the impugned order dated
29.10.2009 (Annexure-12) imposing upon the petitioner a penalty of

withholding one increment with cumulative effect.

11. Being aggrieved, the petitioner filed an appeal under
Regulation-8 of the Regulation before the Board on 16.12.2009. However,
the Board vide its decision taken in the 34 Board meeting held on
10.12.2010, rejected the appeal of the petitioner and upheld the penalty
imposed upon the petitioner. The petitioner being highly aggrieved is
before this Court.

12. Appearing for the petitioner, Ms. P Bhattacharjee, the learned
counsel submits that the imposition of the penalty by withholding one
increment with cumulative effect and also the manner in which the
departmental proceeding was drawn up against the petitioner is
unsustainable under the given facts and circumstances. She submits that
the petitioner prior to filing of the FIR duly informed his superiors and it
was as per their instruction that he had filed the FIR on 20.12.2007. She
Submits that the investigation was carried out by the police authorities
pursuant to the filing of the FIR and thereafter the Final Report submitted
before the Court. The petitioner being summoned by the Court had only
Submitted his no objection against the report submitted by the police
authorities. That by itself cannot be the ground to proceed with the
petitioner departmentally since the petitioner had not committed any
wrong. She submits that FIR was only an instrument to put the
investigation in motion and it is only by appreciating the contents of the
Final Report that Court can proceed with the trial or discharge the

accused. She submits that the acceptance of the petitioner with regard to

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 7 of 16
the Final Report cannot therefore have any bearing in the order to be
passed by the learned CJ] M. She submits that the CJM by considering the
materials available pursuant to the investigation done by the Investigation
Officer found no prima facie case against the respondent No.4 and
accordingly discharged him from the case. Therefore, the petitioner on the
said premises could not have been proceeded with by the respondent

authorities by charging him for violating the Regulation.

13. Ms. P Bhattacharjee further submits that the respondent
authorities are very well aware of their rights. If they were not satisfied
with the discharge of the respondent No.4, they are not prevented from
filing appeal or otherwise against the order of discharge. The said
procedure was not adopted by the respondent authorities and instead the
petitioner has been made the scapegoat. She also draws the attention of
the Court to the order dated 4.8.2008 by which the respondent No.4 was
proceeded with departmentally and as a result his pay was reduced by
one increment in the existing time scale with immediate effect.
Subsequently, vide office order dated 17.12.2009, the penalty imposed
upon respondent No.4 was modified and made effective for only one year
w.e.f. 4.8.2008. She has further drawn the attention of the Court to the
Zimmanama dated 23.12.2007 by which the petitioner had taken the
Zimamanama of the seized materials. She submits that although the
seized materials were taken back from the custody of the Court but no
one has come forth to claim the said materials. The petitioner was
transferred from the Division to Kaliabar Electrical Sub-Division and
pursuant to which on seeking instruction from his superior, he was asked
to hand over the unclaimed materials to his reliever. She therefore

Submits that as there is none to claim the said materials, the question of

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 8 of 16
implicating the petitioner and thereafter imposing upon him the impugned

penalty is not justified and unsustainable.

14. Ms. P Bhattacharjee by referring to the appeal filed by the
writ petitioner on 16.12.2009 also submits that despite the fact that the
petitioner had taken reasonable and good grounds of appeal, the appellate
authority i.e. the Board, failed to consider the appeal of the petitioner in
terms of the powers conferred upon the Board as per the Regulation. She
Submits that instead of a consideration as per the relevant provisions, the
Board in a most perfunctory manner summarily rejected the appeal of the
petitioner.She therefore submits that under the given facts and
circumstances, the impugned order of penalty dated 29.10.2009 and the
decision of the Board taken on 10.12.2010 cannot be sustained and the
same should be set aside and quashed. Ms. P Bhattacharjee also submits
that the punishment of withholding one increment with cumulative effect
aS was imposed upon the petitioner vide order dated 29.10.2009 Is not
provided for in the Regulation and therefore the petitioner could not have
been imposed with such a penalty. The Regulation clearly provides that
the stoppage of increment has to be for a specified period. She therefore
Submits that even on this count, the imposed penalty upon the petitioner

IS not sustainable.

15. Appearing for the respondents APDCL, Mr. S Chakraborthy
Submits that the impugned order of penalty inflicted upon the petitioner as
well as the order passed by the appellate forum is sustainable in law. Mr.
S Chakraborthy submits that when the discovery was made by the
petitioner with regard to the materials which were unauthorizedly found at

the proposed BTS site of the BSNL, the petitioner on instruction was asked

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 9 of 16
to file FIR which he filed accordingly on 20.12.2007 implicating the
respondent No.4 as he claimed to be the recipient of the same. Besides
the FIR, the respondent authorities initiated the departmental proceedings
against the respondent No.4 by placing him under suspension on
28.12.2007. Thereafter he was chargesheeted on 23.1.2008 wherein the
petitioner was also asked to depose as the prosecution witness on
10.4.2008. In the enquiry proceeding, the petitioner deposed of the
alleged involvement of the respondent No.4 on the recovered materials.
While such was the stand of the petitioner in the FIR as well as in the
departmental enquiry initiated against the respondent No. 4, the petitioner
on 30.9.2008 submitted his no objection in writing before the CM,
Nagaon stating that he had no objection against the report submitted by
the police in connection with the Nagaon Police Station Case No.978 of
2007 and thereby resulting in the discharge of the respondent No.4.
Therefore, the stand of the petitioner being most contradictory, the
respondent authorities found a prima facie case against him for his
doubtful integrity and unreliable behavior against the interest of the
company attracting Regulation 10(1) of the Regulation. The petitioner’s
reply to the show cause notice not being found satisfactory, a detailed
departmental proceeding was drawn up against him which resulted with

the finding that the charge against the petitioner to be proved.

16. Mr. S Chakraborthy submits that the entire enquiry proceeding
was conducted in a free and fair manner and the petitioner was given all
the opportunity to present his case and therefore the unsubstantiated
stand of the petitioner that the enquiry officer was absolutely biased and
findings perverse is without any basis. He submits that with the discovery

made by the writ petitioner, the FIR was filed on the instruction of the

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 10 of 16
respondent authorities and therefore, the complaint was made on behalf
of the respondents Company. However, the petitioner without consulting
his superiors proceeded to file his no-objection against the Final Report of
the Investigation Officer which resulted in the discharge of the respondent
No.4. Such action/inaction on the part of the writ petitioner is most
unprecedented and against the interest of the company while he being
one of the employee himself. The no-objection submitted by the petitioner
while helping the respondent No.4 to be discharged by the C)M also
clearly indicate the doubtful integrity of the petitioner since his statements
before the enquiry proceeding against the respondent No.4 implicated his
Involvement. Therefore, upon completion of the enquiry and the charge
being proved, the petitioner was duly issued a second show cause notice
giving him another opportunity to show cause as to why the proposed
penalty should not be inflicted upon him. Thereafter, upon consideration
of the reply given by the petitioner, the disciplinary authority decided to
impose the penalty of stoppage of one increment with cumulative effect.
The appeal of the petitioner was also duly considered by the Board and
after taking into account that all the procedures and formalities had been
duly applied before imposition of penalty, the Board found that there was
no ground to interfere with the findings and quantum of the penalty

imposed upon the petitioner and thus upheld the impugned order of

penalty.

17. Mr. S Chakraborhty further submits that unless there is
irregularity committed during the enquiry proceedings or that the findings
of the enquiry officer is perverse and not based on relevant materials,
Court would not interfere with such proceedings and also on the penalty

consequently imposed upon the delinquent officer. He submits that in the

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 11 of 16
instant case as well, the respondent authorities have given all the
opportunity to the petitioner and the enquiry proceeding was conducted
by following the established procedures and norms and therefore no
Interference is called for. He further submits that with regard to the
respondent No.4 being imposed with a lesser penalty, the same is a
different matter altogether in as much as the charge made out against the
petitioner is of his gross negligence of his assigned duty and the
contradictory stand taken by him within a short span of time found to be
in violation of the Regulation of the Company. The charge clearly being
established, there is no scope for drawing up of corollary with the
proceedings against the respondent No.4. He thus submits that under the
facts and circumstances, the writ petition being without merit should be

dismissed.

18. | have heard the learned counsel for the rival parties and |
have perused the materials available on record. Mr. S Chakraborhty has
also produced the relevant records pertaining to the departmental
proceedings and | have also perused the same. The facts which emerged
from the pleadings and contentions of the rival parties is that the FIR was
lodged on 20.12.2007 by the petitioner pursuant to the consultation with
his superiors on the discovery made by him while making a site visit to
the proposed BTS site of the BSNL. The materials which were found at the
site was claimed by the respondent No. 4 as ABADRP materials and that
he was the recipient of the same. The same having been found to be
irregular, FIR was lodged but however after the investigation was
conducted and completed, the learned C)M did not find it fit to proceed
against respondent No. 4 and discharged him from the liability vide order

dated 30.9.2008. The role of the petitioner in the process was his filing of

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 12 of 16
no-objection against the police report filed by the Investigation Officer.
This action of the petitioner was found to be contrary to the deposition he
had made against the departmental enquiry conducted against the
respondent No.4 which led to the issuance of the show cause notice to
him as well. The action of the writ petitioner was found to be in violation
of the Regulation 10(1) since his statements were found to be
contradictory. On perusal of the records produced by Mr. S chakraborhty,
it can be seen that the petitioner had informed the Senior Manager,
Nagaon Electrical Division -| Nagaon on 19.12.2007 that the materials
which were found at the site were of the approximate value of Rs.3,
54,000/- and respondent No.4 apparently was responsible for diverting the
materials and thereby confirmed his involvement in the matter with the ill
motive. It was also stated in the said communication that the materials
have been procured by the respondent No.4 without prior approval and
intimation from the competent authority as was informed by the petitioner

on earlier occasion.

19. Considering the stand of the writ petitioner and the no-objection to
the Final Report submitted before the C) M, the charge framed against the
petitioner can only be the natural outcome of the conduct of the
petitioner. Although the petitioner has maintained that the enquiry
proceedings conducted by the enquiry officer was absolutely bias,
perverse and perfunctory, | find that the same Is only an averment of
routine nature as the petitioner was afforded opportunity for responding
to the steps taken by the disciplinary authority right from the issuance of
the first show cause notice upto the issuance of the ultimate notice upon
the submission of the enquiry report and therefore on the averment that

the proceedings have been vitiated on account of arbitrariness or

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 13 of 16
perversity, in my considered view is not to be found. However, at the
same time, the petitioner having been imposed with a penalty has the
right to ventilate his grievance against the penalty imposed before the
appellate forum which in the instant case is the Board. Regulation 10(8)
and Regulation 10(9) provides that the officer may prefer an appeal
against the order of penalty/penalties specified in the Regulation within a
period of two months from the date of receipt of the order by which the
appellant is aggrieved and thereafter the appeal is to be considered by the
Board on certain parameter including the justification of the findings the
excessiveness of the penalty and Its adequateness etc. Thereafter, the
Board may set aside, reduce, confirm or enhance the penalty or even
remit the case back to the authority for imposition of such penalty as it
may deem fit . A perusal of the said provision clearly indicates that some
responsibilities is cast upon the appellate authority to consider the appeal
before it. In the instant case, the appellate authority i.e. the Board in Its
34"". Board meeting held on 10.12.2010 apparently appears to have
Summarily considered the appeal of the petitioner while rejecting the

same.

20. It may also be noticed herein that the penalties that can be
imposed upon the officer of the establishment are provided in Regulation10(2) (a) wherein amongst the various types of penalties that can be
imposed, ‘stoppage of increment for a specific period’ has been provided
at Regulation 10(2) (a) (ili). However, in the case of the petitioner the
penalty imposed upon him was no doubt stoppage of one year increment
but the same has been made with cumulative effect. While examining the
penalty imposed upon the petitioner, it may not be out of place to notice

the fact that respondent No.4 although proceeded with a separate enquiry

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 14 of 16
proceeding altogether was imposed with the penalty of reduction of pay
by one increment in the existing time scale. The said penalty was
Subsequently restricted or made effective for a period of one year only.
Therefore, it can be seen that the respondent authorities are aware of the
fact that if the penalty of increment is to be withheld, the duration of the

penalty is to be specified in terms of the Regulation aforementioned.

21. The role of the Court as well as the extent to which it is
required to travel while examining the process of departmental
proceedings is well settled. The role of the Court is mainly confined to
examining the decision making process and not the decision itself. Court
iS not prevented from appropriately interfering with such proceeding if the
Same is found to be perverse or the conclusion so reached is not based
upon the relevant materials in the proceedings. As may be noticed, the
departmental proceeding being vitiated due to perversity or irregularities is
not be found in the proceedings drawn up against the petitioner and
therefore, interference on that count would not be called for. However,
upon finding the manner in which the appeal of the petitioner has been
addressed and also the kind of penalties found in the Regulation, | am of
the considered view that the penalty imposed upon the petitioner should
be re-considered by the authority |.e. the Board. It is submitted at the bar
that the petitioner has since retired from service from the post of SubDivisional Engineer while posted at Nagaon on 31.8.2015. Therefore, it
would be only be incumbent upon the Board to examine the appeal of the
petitioner afresh by taking into account the types of penalties provided in
the Regulation at the same time expeditiously since his pension would be

determined on the basis of the outcome of the appeal

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 15 of 16
22. Having opined thus, the writ petition is disposed of with a
direction to the respondent No.2 i.e. the Chairman and Managing Director,
APDCL to place the appeal of the petitioner before the Board within a
period of 3(three) weeks from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this
order and the Board shall thereafter consider and dispose the appeal
within a period of 2(two) months from the date of receipt of the appeal
keeping in mind the observation made hereinabove. The decision of the
Board shall be communicated to the petitioner. Petitioner shall also be at
liberty to submit a copy of the writ petition alongwith annexures appended
thereto before the respondent No.2 for consideration of the Board. In the
result, the decision of the Board dismissing the appeal of the petitioner
vide its 34 meeting minutes dated 10.12.2010 is hereby interfered with.

23. It is also made clear that so far as the findings of the enquiry
officer is concerned, the same has not been interfered with but it is the
quantum of the penalty that has been imposed upon the petitioner that Is
to be considered by the Board at Its discretion based upon sound

principles and the Regulation as well.

24. No cost.

| UDGMENT AND ORDER (ORAL)

Heard Ms. P Bhattacharjee, the learned counsel for the
petitioner and Mr. S Chakraborthy, Standing Counsel, Assam Power
Distribution Company Ltd. (APDCL). None appears for the respondent

No.4 despite notice.

2. Brief facts of the case may be narrated at the outset. The
petitioner who was working as Deputy Manager at Kaliabor Electrical SubDivision, Nagaon under the APDCL at the relevant time on 20.12.2007
(Annexure-1) submitted an FIR before the Officer-in-Charge of the
Haiborgaon Police outpost in the district of Nagaon to the effect that on
15.12.2007 during his visit to the proposed BTS site of BSNL, Mullapattay,
Nagaon, he noticed three labourers brining some Conductor from a
Conductor Drum and on upon making a query he was informed that one
Sri Dhruva Lal Dey (Respondent No.4), , FME, NESD-III| gave them
instructions for bringing the conductor to that place. Respondent No.4
soon after arrived on the spot and claimed that the materials were APDRP
materials and he was the recipient. However, since the materials were not
Supposed to be available at the place where it was found without proper
authorization, the petitioner upon being instructed, submitted an FIR by
incorporating the total value of the materials that was found with an
estimate of Rs,3,54, 000/-.

3. Pursuant to the FIR, a criminal case under section 409/411 of

the IPC was registered under the Nagaon Police Station Case No.978 of

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 2 of 16
2007 and investigation was made by the assigned police officer.
Consequently, the Investigation Officer submitted the Final Report and the
learned Chief Judicial Magistrate of Nagaon issued summon to the
petitioner directing him to appear before the Court on 30.9.2008 for
raising objections against the Final Report of the Investigation Officer if
any. On 30.9.2008, the petitioner appeared before the Court and
Submitted his no-objection to the Final Report of the Investigation Officer.
Thereafter vide order dated 30.9.2008, the learned G/M discharged the

respondent No. 4 from the police case registered against him.

4. Thereafter on 3.12.2008(Annexure-5), the respondent No.3
issued a show cause notice to the petitioner requiring him to show cause
on the allegation that prima facie the petitioner appeared to have doubtful
Integrity and unreliable behavior against the interest of the company
amounting to misconduct under Rule 10 (f) of the ASEB (General Services)
Regulation (for officers), 1960 (The Regulation). It was stated that the
order of discharge in favour of the respondent No.4 dated 30.9.2008 was
a result of the no-objection submitted by the petitioner against the Final
report of the Investigation Officer although the petitioner himself had
lodged the FIR. Furthermore, on 10.4.2008 during the departmental
proceedings drawn up against the respondent No.4, the petitioner had
clearly deposed before the Enquiry Officer of the alleged involvement of

the respondent No.4 for the theft of the materials mentioned in the FIR.

5. Against the show cause notice, the petitioner submitted his
reply on 13.12.2008 denying the allegation made against him and that he
had not violated the Regulation-10(1) as alleged. He stated that there was

nothing wrong in the submission of the no-objection against the Final

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 3 of 16
report submitted by the Investigation Officer in aS much as the
Investigation Officer after making his investigation did not find sufficient
materials to implicate the respondent No.4 and in fact if the establishment
was not satisfied with the discharge of the respondent No.4, appropriate
remedy was available through the relevant provisions of the Code of
Criminal Procedure. He submits that the allegations were only

misconceived and he was being victimized.

6. The respondent authorities not being satisfied with the reply of
the petitioner to the show cause notice, issued a charge sheet on
21.4.2009 (Annexure-7) whereby two charges were drawn against the
petitioner i.e. negligence of duty and breach of the ASEB Office
(Conduct)Regulations, 1982. Petitioner was asked to submit his statement

of defense within 10 days from the date of receipt of the communication.

7. Regulation-10(1) as provided in the statement of allegation of the
charge sheet may be reproduced for reference:
Regulation-10(1) and the Regulation 3(1)

“Regulation-10(1): Every Officer of the Board shall
discharge the duties assigned to him with integrity, loyalty and
promptitute and carryout all lawful orders of his superiors in respect of the
duties assigned to him’.

“Regulation-3(1):EveryOfticer of the Boara/Company
Shall at all times (i) maintain absolute integrity (i!) maintain devotion to
duty (il) do nothing which Is unbecoming of an Officer of the

Board/Company”.

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 4 of 16
8. The charge of negligence of duty was substantiated in the
statements of allegations made against the petitioner aS was
communicated vide show cause notice dated 3.12.2008. Further, as for
the charge No.2 t.e. breach of the Regulation, the petitioner was alleged
to have failed to maintain absolute integrity, devotion to his duty and
acted in a manner which is unbecoming of an Officer of the Board/
Company and thereby clearly a breach of the Regulation. Along with the
Charge sheet, a list of documents as well as list of witnesses were also

provided under the heading ‘Annexure-1’.

9. The petitioner against the charge sheet submitted his reply on
4.5.2009 (Annexure-8) denying the charge made out against him. The
petitioner stated that whatever statement that was made by him during
the departmental enquiry against the respondent No.4 were only based on
the materials available on the official records and not on the basis of his
personal knowledge. He also stated that the application submitted by him
before the Court were not the basis of the order dated 30.9.2008 passed
by the learned CJM discharging the respondent No.4. Therefore, his
application before the Court or the order dated 30.9.2008 not being
furnished to him could not be the basis of the charge made out against
him. He also stated that after the respondent No.4 was discharged and
the Zimanama cancelled, the seized articles were neither claimed by the
Electricity Board nor by the respondent No.4. Therefore, in the absence of
any loss sustained by the Board, the question of the petitioner being
charged with negligence or failure of supervision did not arise. He

therefore prayed that the charges be dropped against him.

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 5 of 16
10. The respondents nevertheless proceeded with the enquiry by
appointing an Enquiry Officer for the purpose. The Enquiry Officer after
completion of the enquiry submitted his report on 28.8.2009 (Annexure-9)
with a finding that the charge against the petitioner in terms of the charge
sheet dated 21.4.2009 were found to be proved. The Enquiry Officer
found that although the petitioner in his written statements contended
that his deposition during the departmental enquiry made against the
respondent No. 4 were based on materials available in the official records
and not on his personal knowledge, were in fact not substantiated by him
to show as to what records he was referring to. The statements of the
petitioner was clearly inconsistent as he had clearly implicated the
respondent No.4 during the departmental enquiry against the respondent
No.4 where he was cited as one of the department witness and he also
clearly mentioned the same in the FIR whereas in the petition filed by him
before the Court he accepted the Final Report made by the Investigation
Officer leading to the discharge of the respondent No.4. Moreover, the
petitioner before filing the petition before the Court should have consulted
his superior i.e. the Deputy General Manager. Thus, the charge of
negligence was proved and on that count the charge No.2 also stood
proved to the extent it was proved against charge No.1. Consequently, the
respondent authorities vide communication dated 8.10.2009 (Annexure10) issued a second show cause notice to the petitioner contemplating the
imposition of a penalty of reduction to a lower stage by withholding five
Increments with cumulative effect. The petitioner by the same
communication was asked to be present for personal hearing on
28.10.2009 at the designated office chamber given in the notice. Although
the petitioner filed his reply to the second show cause notice dated
8.10.2009 before the Managing Director on 28.10.2009, the Chairman

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 6 of 16
Director of APDCL nevertheless passed the impugned order dated
29.10.2009 (Annexure-12) imposing upon the petitioner a penalty of

withholding one increment with cumulative effect.

11. Being aggrieved, the petitioner filed an appeal under
Regulation-8 of the Regulation before the Board on 16.12.2009. However,
the Board vide its decision taken in the 34 Board meeting held on
10.12.2010, rejected the appeal of the petitioner and upheld the penalty
imposed upon the petitioner. The petitioner being highly aggrieved is
before this Court.

12. Appearing for the petitioner, Ms. P Bhattacharjee, the learned
counsel submits that the imposition of the penalty by withholding one
increment with cumulative effect and also the manner in which the
departmental proceeding was drawn up against the petitioner is
unsustainable under the given facts and circumstances. She submits that
the petitioner prior to filing of the FIR duly informed his superiors and it
was as per their instruction that he had filed the FIR on 20.12.2007. She
Submits that the investigation was carried out by the police authorities
pursuant to the filing of the FIR and thereafter the Final Report submitted
before the Court. The petitioner being summoned by the Court had only
Submitted his no objection against the report submitted by the police
authorities. That by itself cannot be the ground to proceed with the
petitioner departmentally since the petitioner had not committed any
wrong. She submits that FIR was only an instrument to put the
investigation in motion and it is only by appreciating the contents of the
Final Report that Court can proceed with the trial or discharge the

accused. She submits that the acceptance of the petitioner with regard to

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 7 of 16
the Final Report cannot therefore have any bearing in the order to be
passed by the learned CJ] M. She submits that the CJM by considering the
materials available pursuant to the investigation done by the Investigation
Officer found no prima facie case against the respondent No.4 and
accordingly discharged him from the case. Therefore, the petitioner on the
said premises could not have been proceeded with by the respondent

authorities by charging him for violating the Regulation.

13. Ms. P Bhattacharjee further submits that the respondent
authorities are very well aware of their rights. If they were not satisfied
with the discharge of the respondent No.4, they are not prevented from
filing appeal or otherwise against the order of discharge. The said
procedure was not adopted by the respondent authorities and instead the
petitioner has been made the scapegoat. She also draws the attention of
the Court to the order dated 4.8.2008 by which the respondent No.4 was
proceeded with departmentally and as a result his pay was reduced by
one increment in the existing time scale with immediate effect.
Subsequently, vide office order dated 17.12.2009, the penalty imposed
upon respondent No.4 was modified and made effective for only one year
w.e.f. 4.8.2008. She has further drawn the attention of the Court to the
Zimmanama dated 23.12.2007 by which the petitioner had taken the
Zimamanama of the seized materials. She submits that although the
seized materials were taken back from the custody of the Court but no
one has come forth to claim the said materials. The petitioner was
transferred from the Division to Kaliabar Electrical Sub-Division and
pursuant to which on seeking instruction from his superior, he was asked
to hand over the unclaimed materials to his reliever. She therefore

Submits that as there is none to claim the said materials, the question of

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 8 of 16
implicating the petitioner and thereafter imposing upon him the impugned

penalty is not justified and unsustainable.

14. Ms. P Bhattacharjee by referring to the appeal filed by the
writ petitioner on 16.12.2009 also submits that despite the fact that the
petitioner had taken reasonable and good grounds of appeal, the appellate
authority i.e. the Board, failed to consider the appeal of the petitioner in
terms of the powers conferred upon the Board as per the Regulation. She
Submits that instead of a consideration as per the relevant provisions, the
Board in a most perfunctory manner summarily rejected the appeal of the
petitioner.She therefore submits that under the given facts and
circumstances, the impugned order of penalty dated 29.10.2009 and the
decision of the Board taken on 10.12.2010 cannot be sustained and the
same should be set aside and quashed. Ms. P Bhattacharjee also submits
that the punishment of withholding one increment with cumulative effect
aS was imposed upon the petitioner vide order dated 29.10.2009 Is not
provided for in the Regulation and therefore the petitioner could not have
been imposed with such a penalty. The Regulation clearly provides that
the stoppage of increment has to be for a specified period. She therefore
Submits that even on this count, the imposed penalty upon the petitioner

IS not sustainable.

15. Appearing for the respondents APDCL, Mr. S Chakraborthy
Submits that the impugned order of penalty inflicted upon the petitioner as
well as the order passed by the appellate forum is sustainable in law. Mr.
S Chakraborthy submits that when the discovery was made by the
petitioner with regard to the materials which were unauthorizedly found at

the proposed BTS site of the BSNL, the petitioner on instruction was asked

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 9 of 16
to file FIR which he filed accordingly on 20.12.2007 implicating the
respondent No.4 as he claimed to be the recipient of the same. Besides
the FIR, the respondent authorities initiated the departmental proceedings
against the respondent No.4 by placing him under suspension on
28.12.2007. Thereafter he was chargesheeted on 23.1.2008 wherein the
petitioner was also asked to depose as the prosecution witness on
10.4.2008. In the enquiry proceeding, the petitioner deposed of the
alleged involvement of the respondent No.4 on the recovered materials.
While such was the stand of the petitioner in the FIR as well as in the
departmental enquiry initiated against the respondent No. 4, the petitioner
on 30.9.2008 submitted his no objection in writing before the CM,
Nagaon stating that he had no objection against the report submitted by
the police in connection with the Nagaon Police Station Case No.978 of
2007 and thereby resulting in the discharge of the respondent No.4.
Therefore, the stand of the petitioner being most contradictory, the
respondent authorities found a prima facie case against him for his
doubtful integrity and unreliable behavior against the interest of the
company attracting Regulation 10(1) of the Regulation. The petitioner’s
reply to the show cause notice not being found satisfactory, a detailed
departmental proceeding was drawn up against him which resulted with

the finding that the charge against the petitioner to be proved.

16. Mr. S Chakraborthy submits that the entire enquiry proceeding
was conducted in a free and fair manner and the petitioner was given all
the opportunity to present his case and therefore the unsubstantiated
stand of the petitioner that the enquiry officer was absolutely biased and
findings perverse is without any basis. He submits that with the discovery

made by the writ petitioner, the FIR was filed on the instruction of the

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 10 of 16
respondent authorities and therefore, the complaint was made on behalf
of the respondents Company. However, the petitioner without consulting
his superiors proceeded to file his no-objection against the Final Report of
the Investigation Officer which resulted in the discharge of the respondent
No.4. Such action/inaction on the part of the writ petitioner is most
unprecedented and against the interest of the company while he being
one of the employee himself. The no-objection submitted by the petitioner
while helping the respondent No.4 to be discharged by the C)M also
clearly indicate the doubtful integrity of the petitioner since his statements
before the enquiry proceeding against the respondent No.4 implicated his
Involvement. Therefore, upon completion of the enquiry and the charge
being proved, the petitioner was duly issued a second show cause notice
giving him another opportunity to show cause as to why the proposed
penalty should not be inflicted upon him. Thereafter, upon consideration
of the reply given by the petitioner, the disciplinary authority decided to
impose the penalty of stoppage of one increment with cumulative effect.
The appeal of the petitioner was also duly considered by the Board and
after taking into account that all the procedures and formalities had been
duly applied before imposition of penalty, the Board found that there was
no ground to interfere with the findings and quantum of the penalty

imposed upon the petitioner and thus upheld the impugned order of

penalty.

17. Mr. S Chakraborhty further submits that unless there is
irregularity committed during the enquiry proceedings or that the findings
of the enquiry officer is perverse and not based on relevant materials,
Court would not interfere with such proceedings and also on the penalty

consequently imposed upon the delinquent officer. He submits that in the

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 11 of 16
instant case as well, the respondent authorities have given all the
opportunity to the petitioner and the enquiry proceeding was conducted
by following the established procedures and norms and therefore no
Interference is called for. He further submits that with regard to the
respondent No.4 being imposed with a lesser penalty, the same is a
different matter altogether in as much as the charge made out against the
petitioner is of his gross negligence of his assigned duty and the
contradictory stand taken by him within a short span of time found to be
in violation of the Regulation of the Company. The charge clearly being
established, there is no scope for drawing up of corollary with the
proceedings against the respondent No.4. He thus submits that under the
facts and circumstances, the writ petition being without merit should be

dismissed.

18. | have heard the learned counsel for the rival parties and |
have perused the materials available on record. Mr. S Chakraborhty has
also produced the relevant records pertaining to the departmental
proceedings and | have also perused the same. The facts which emerged
from the pleadings and contentions of the rival parties is that the FIR was
lodged on 20.12.2007 by the petitioner pursuant to the consultation with
his superiors on the discovery made by him while making a site visit to
the proposed BTS site of the BSNL. The materials which were found at the
site was claimed by the respondent No. 4 as ABADRP materials and that
he was the recipient of the same. The same having been found to be
irregular, FIR was lodged but however after the investigation was
conducted and completed, the learned C)M did not find it fit to proceed
against respondent No. 4 and discharged him from the liability vide order

dated 30.9.2008. The role of the petitioner in the process was his filing of

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 12 of 16
no-objection against the police report filed by the Investigation Officer.
This action of the petitioner was found to be contrary to the deposition he
had made against the departmental enquiry conducted against the
respondent No.4 which led to the issuance of the show cause notice to
him as well. The action of the writ petitioner was found to be in violation
of the Regulation 10(1) since his statements were found to be
contradictory. On perusal of the records produced by Mr. S chakraborhty,
it can be seen that the petitioner had informed the Senior Manager,
Nagaon Electrical Division -| Nagaon on 19.12.2007 that the materials
which were found at the site were of the approximate value of Rs.3,
54,000/- and respondent No.4 apparently was responsible for diverting the
materials and thereby confirmed his involvement in the matter with the ill
motive. It was also stated in the said communication that the materials
have been procured by the respondent No.4 without prior approval and
intimation from the competent authority as was informed by the petitioner

on earlier occasion.

19. Considering the stand of the writ petitioner and the no-objection to
the Final Report submitted before the C) M, the charge framed against the
petitioner can only be the natural outcome of the conduct of the
petitioner. Although the petitioner has maintained that the enquiry
proceedings conducted by the enquiry officer was absolutely bias,
perverse and perfunctory, | find that the same Is only an averment of
routine nature as the petitioner was afforded opportunity for responding
to the steps taken by the disciplinary authority right from the issuance of
the first show cause notice upto the issuance of the ultimate notice upon
the submission of the enquiry report and therefore on the averment that

the proceedings have been vitiated on account of arbitrariness or

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 13 of 16
perversity, in my considered view is not to be found. However, at the
same time, the petitioner having been imposed with a penalty has the
right to ventilate his grievance against the penalty imposed before the
appellate forum which in the instant case is the Board. Regulation 10(8)
and Regulation 10(9) provides that the officer may prefer an appeal
against the order of penalty/penalties specified in the Regulation within a
period of two months from the date of receipt of the order by which the
appellant is aggrieved and thereafter the appeal is to be considered by the
Board on certain parameter including the justification of the findings the
excessiveness of the penalty and Its adequateness etc. Thereafter, the
Board may set aside, reduce, confirm or enhance the penalty or even
remit the case back to the authority for imposition of such penalty as it
may deem fit . A perusal of the said provision clearly indicates that some
responsibilities is cast upon the appellate authority to consider the appeal
before it. In the instant case, the appellate authority i.e. the Board in Its
34"". Board meeting held on 10.12.2010 apparently appears to have
Summarily considered the appeal of the petitioner while rejecting the

same.

20. It may also be noticed herein that the penalties that can be
imposed upon the officer of the establishment are provided in Regulation10(2) (a) wherein amongst the various types of penalties that can be
imposed, ‘stoppage of increment for a specific period’ has been provided
at Regulation 10(2) (a) (ili). However, in the case of the petitioner the
penalty imposed upon him was no doubt stoppage of one year increment
but the same has been made with cumulative effect. While examining the
penalty imposed upon the petitioner, it may not be out of place to notice

the fact that respondent No.4 although proceeded with a separate enquiry

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 14 of 16
proceeding altogether was imposed with the penalty of reduction of pay
by one increment in the existing time scale. The said penalty was
Subsequently restricted or made effective for a period of one year only.
Therefore, it can be seen that the respondent authorities are aware of the
fact that if the penalty of increment is to be withheld, the duration of the

penalty is to be specified in terms of the Regulation aforementioned.

21. The role of the Court as well as the extent to which it is
required to travel while examining the process of departmental
proceedings is well settled. The role of the Court is mainly confined to
examining the decision making process and not the decision itself. Court
iS not prevented from appropriately interfering with such proceeding if the
Same is found to be perverse or the conclusion so reached is not based
upon the relevant materials in the proceedings. As may be noticed, the
departmental proceeding being vitiated due to perversity or irregularities is
not be found in the proceedings drawn up against the petitioner and
therefore, interference on that count would not be called for. However,
upon finding the manner in which the appeal of the petitioner has been
addressed and also the kind of penalties found in the Regulation, | am of
the considered view that the penalty imposed upon the petitioner should
be re-considered by the authority |.e. the Board. It is submitted at the bar
that the petitioner has since retired from service from the post of SubDivisional Engineer while posted at Nagaon on 31.8.2015. Therefore, it
would be only be incumbent upon the Board to examine the appeal of the
petitioner afresh by taking into account the types of penalties provided in
the Regulation at the same time expeditiously since his pension would be

determined on the basis of the outcome of the appeal

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 15 of 16
22. Having opined thus, the writ petition is disposed of with a
direction to the respondent No.2 i.e. the Chairman and Managing Director,
APDCL to place the appeal of the petitioner before the Board within a
period of 3(three) weeks from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this
order and the Board shall thereafter consider and dispose the appeal
within a period of 2(two) months from the date of receipt of the appeal
keeping in mind the observation made hereinabove. The decision of the
Board shall be communicated to the petitioner. Petitioner shall also be at
liberty to submit a copy of the writ petition alongwith annexures appended
thereto before the respondent No.2 for consideration of the Board. In the
result, the decision of the Board dismissing the appeal of the petitioner
vide its 34 meeting minutes dated 10.12.2010 is hereby interfered with.

23. It is also made clear that so far as the findings of the enquiry
officer is concerned, the same has not been interfered with but it is the
quantum of the penalty that has been imposed upon the petitioner that Is
to be considered by the Board at Its discretion based upon sound

principles and the Regulation as well.

24. No cost.

| UDGMENT AND ORDER (ORAL)

Heard Ms. P Bhattacharjee, the learned counsel for the
petitioner and Mr. S Chakraborthy, Standing Counsel, Assam Power
Distribution Company Ltd. (APDCL). None appears for the respondent

No.4 despite notice.

2. Brief facts of the case may be narrated at the outset. The
petitioner who was working as Deputy Manager at Kaliabor Electrical SubDivision, Nagaon under the APDCL at the relevant time on 20.12.2007
(Annexure-1) submitted an FIR before the Officer-in-Charge of the
Haiborgaon Police outpost in the district of Nagaon to the effect that on
15.12.2007 during his visit to the proposed BTS site of BSNL, Mullapattay,
Nagaon, he noticed three labourers brining some Conductor from a
Conductor Drum and on upon making a query he was informed that one
Sri Dhruva Lal Dey (Respondent No.4), , FME, NESD-III| gave them
instructions for bringing the conductor to that place. Respondent No.4
soon after arrived on the spot and claimed that the materials were APDRP
materials and he was the recipient. However, since the materials were not
Supposed to be available at the place where it was found without proper
authorization, the petitioner upon being instructed, submitted an FIR by
incorporating the total value of the materials that was found with an
estimate of Rs,3,54, 000/-.

3. Pursuant to the FIR, a criminal case under section 409/411 of

the IPC was registered under the Nagaon Police Station Case No.978 of

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 2 of 16
2007 and investigation was made by the assigned police officer.
Consequently, the Investigation Officer submitted the Final Report and the
learned Chief Judicial Magistrate of Nagaon issued summon to the
petitioner directing him to appear before the Court on 30.9.2008 for
raising objections against the Final Report of the Investigation Officer if
any. On 30.9.2008, the petitioner appeared before the Court and
Submitted his no-objection to the Final Report of the Investigation Officer.
Thereafter vide order dated 30.9.2008, the learned G/M discharged the

respondent No. 4 from the police case registered against him.

4. Thereafter on 3.12.2008(Annexure-5), the respondent No.3
issued a show cause notice to the petitioner requiring him to show cause
on the allegation that prima facie the petitioner appeared to have doubtful
Integrity and unreliable behavior against the interest of the company
amounting to misconduct under Rule 10 (f) of the ASEB (General Services)
Regulation (for officers), 1960 (The Regulation). It was stated that the
order of discharge in favour of the respondent No.4 dated 30.9.2008 was
a result of the no-objection submitted by the petitioner against the Final
report of the Investigation Officer although the petitioner himself had
lodged the FIR. Furthermore, on 10.4.2008 during the departmental
proceedings drawn up against the respondent No.4, the petitioner had
clearly deposed before the Enquiry Officer of the alleged involvement of

the respondent No.4 for the theft of the materials mentioned in the FIR.

5. Against the show cause notice, the petitioner submitted his
reply on 13.12.2008 denying the allegation made against him and that he
had not violated the Regulation-10(1) as alleged. He stated that there was

nothing wrong in the submission of the no-objection against the Final

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 3 of 16
report submitted by the Investigation Officer in aS much as the
Investigation Officer after making his investigation did not find sufficient
materials to implicate the respondent No.4 and in fact if the establishment
was not satisfied with the discharge of the respondent No.4, appropriate
remedy was available through the relevant provisions of the Code of
Criminal Procedure. He submits that the allegations were only

misconceived and he was being victimized.

6. The respondent authorities not being satisfied with the reply of
the petitioner to the show cause notice, issued a charge sheet on
21.4.2009 (Annexure-7) whereby two charges were drawn against the
petitioner i.e. negligence of duty and breach of the ASEB Office
(Conduct)Regulations, 1982. Petitioner was asked to submit his statement

of defense within 10 days from the date of receipt of the communication.

7. Regulation-10(1) as provided in the statement of allegation of the
charge sheet may be reproduced for reference:
Regulation-10(1) and the Regulation 3(1)

“Regulation-10(1): Every Officer of the Board shall
discharge the duties assigned to him with integrity, loyalty and
promptitute and carryout all lawful orders of his superiors in respect of the
duties assigned to him’.

“Regulation-3(1):EveryOfticer of the Boara/Company
Shall at all times (i) maintain absolute integrity (i!) maintain devotion to
duty (il) do nothing which Is unbecoming of an Officer of the

Board/Company”.

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 4 of 16
8. The charge of negligence of duty was substantiated in the
statements of allegations made against the petitioner aS was
communicated vide show cause notice dated 3.12.2008. Further, as for
the charge No.2 t.e. breach of the Regulation, the petitioner was alleged
to have failed to maintain absolute integrity, devotion to his duty and
acted in a manner which is unbecoming of an Officer of the Board/
Company and thereby clearly a breach of the Regulation. Along with the
Charge sheet, a list of documents as well as list of witnesses were also

provided under the heading ‘Annexure-1’.

9. The petitioner against the charge sheet submitted his reply on
4.5.2009 (Annexure-8) denying the charge made out against him. The
petitioner stated that whatever statement that was made by him during
the departmental enquiry against the respondent No.4 were only based on
the materials available on the official records and not on the basis of his
personal knowledge. He also stated that the application submitted by him
before the Court were not the basis of the order dated 30.9.2008 passed
by the learned CJM discharging the respondent No.4. Therefore, his
application before the Court or the order dated 30.9.2008 not being
furnished to him could not be the basis of the charge made out against
him. He also stated that after the respondent No.4 was discharged and
the Zimanama cancelled, the seized articles were neither claimed by the
Electricity Board nor by the respondent No.4. Therefore, in the absence of
any loss sustained by the Board, the question of the petitioner being
charged with negligence or failure of supervision did not arise. He

therefore prayed that the charges be dropped against him.

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 5 of 16
10. The respondents nevertheless proceeded with the enquiry by
appointing an Enquiry Officer for the purpose. The Enquiry Officer after
completion of the enquiry submitted his report on 28.8.2009 (Annexure-9)
with a finding that the charge against the petitioner in terms of the charge
sheet dated 21.4.2009 were found to be proved. The Enquiry Officer
found that although the petitioner in his written statements contended
that his deposition during the departmental enquiry made against the
respondent No. 4 were based on materials available in the official records
and not on his personal knowledge, were in fact not substantiated by him
to show as to what records he was referring to. The statements of the
petitioner was clearly inconsistent as he had clearly implicated the
respondent No.4 during the departmental enquiry against the respondent
No.4 where he was cited as one of the department witness and he also
clearly mentioned the same in the FIR whereas in the petition filed by him
before the Court he accepted the Final Report made by the Investigation
Officer leading to the discharge of the respondent No.4. Moreover, the
petitioner before filing the petition before the Court should have consulted
his superior i.e. the Deputy General Manager. Thus, the charge of
negligence was proved and on that count the charge No.2 also stood
proved to the extent it was proved against charge No.1. Consequently, the
respondent authorities vide communication dated 8.10.2009 (Annexure10) issued a second show cause notice to the petitioner contemplating the
imposition of a penalty of reduction to a lower stage by withholding five
Increments with cumulative effect. The petitioner by the same
communication was asked to be present for personal hearing on
28.10.2009 at the designated office chamber given in the notice. Although
the petitioner filed his reply to the second show cause notice dated
8.10.2009 before the Managing Director on 28.10.2009, the Chairman

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 6 of 16
Director of APDCL nevertheless passed the impugned order dated
29.10.2009 (Annexure-12) imposing upon the petitioner a penalty of

withholding one increment with cumulative effect.

11. Being aggrieved, the petitioner filed an appeal under
Regulation-8 of the Regulation before the Board on 16.12.2009. However,
the Board vide its decision taken in the 34 Board meeting held on
10.12.2010, rejected the appeal of the petitioner and upheld the penalty
imposed upon the petitioner. The petitioner being highly aggrieved is
before this Court.

12. Appearing for the petitioner, Ms. P Bhattacharjee, the learned
counsel submits that the imposition of the penalty by withholding one
increment with cumulative effect and also the manner in which the
departmental proceeding was drawn up against the petitioner is
unsustainable under the given facts and circumstances. She submits that
the petitioner prior to filing of the FIR duly informed his superiors and it
was as per their instruction that he had filed the FIR on 20.12.2007. She
Submits that the investigation was carried out by the police authorities
pursuant to the filing of the FIR and thereafter the Final Report submitted
before the Court. The petitioner being summoned by the Court had only
Submitted his no objection against the report submitted by the police
authorities. That by itself cannot be the ground to proceed with the
petitioner departmentally since the petitioner had not committed any
wrong. She submits that FIR was only an instrument to put the
investigation in motion and it is only by appreciating the contents of the
Final Report that Court can proceed with the trial or discharge the

accused. She submits that the acceptance of the petitioner with regard to

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 7 of 16
the Final Report cannot therefore have any bearing in the order to be
passed by the learned CJ] M. She submits that the CJM by considering the
materials available pursuant to the investigation done by the Investigation
Officer found no prima facie case against the respondent No.4 and
accordingly discharged him from the case. Therefore, the petitioner on the
said premises could not have been proceeded with by the respondent

authorities by charging him for violating the Regulation.

13. Ms. P Bhattacharjee further submits that the respondent
authorities are very well aware of their rights. If they were not satisfied
with the discharge of the respondent No.4, they are not prevented from
filing appeal or otherwise against the order of discharge. The said
procedure was not adopted by the respondent authorities and instead the
petitioner has been made the scapegoat. She also draws the attention of
the Court to the order dated 4.8.2008 by which the respondent No.4 was
proceeded with departmentally and as a result his pay was reduced by
one increment in the existing time scale with immediate effect.
Subsequently, vide office order dated 17.12.2009, the penalty imposed
upon respondent No.4 was modified and made effective for only one year
w.e.f. 4.8.2008. She has further drawn the attention of the Court to the
Zimmanama dated 23.12.2007 by which the petitioner had taken the
Zimamanama of the seized materials. She submits that although the
seized materials were taken back from the custody of the Court but no
one has come forth to claim the said materials. The petitioner was
transferred from the Division to Kaliabar Electrical Sub-Division and
pursuant to which on seeking instruction from his superior, he was asked
to hand over the unclaimed materials to his reliever. She therefore

Submits that as there is none to claim the said materials, the question of

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 8 of 16
implicating the petitioner and thereafter imposing upon him the impugned

penalty is not justified and unsustainable.

14. Ms. P Bhattacharjee by referring to the appeal filed by the
writ petitioner on 16.12.2009 also submits that despite the fact that the
petitioner had taken reasonable and good grounds of appeal, the appellate
authority i.e. the Board, failed to consider the appeal of the petitioner in
terms of the powers conferred upon the Board as per the Regulation. She
Submits that instead of a consideration as per the relevant provisions, the
Board in a most perfunctory manner summarily rejected the appeal of the
petitioner.She therefore submits that under the given facts and
circumstances, the impugned order of penalty dated 29.10.2009 and the
decision of the Board taken on 10.12.2010 cannot be sustained and the
same should be set aside and quashed. Ms. P Bhattacharjee also submits
that the punishment of withholding one increment with cumulative effect
aS was imposed upon the petitioner vide order dated 29.10.2009 Is not
provided for in the Regulation and therefore the petitioner could not have
been imposed with such a penalty. The Regulation clearly provides that
the stoppage of increment has to be for a specified period. She therefore
Submits that even on this count, the imposed penalty upon the petitioner

IS not sustainable.

15. Appearing for the respondents APDCL, Mr. S Chakraborthy
Submits that the impugned order of penalty inflicted upon the petitioner as
well as the order passed by the appellate forum is sustainable in law. Mr.
S Chakraborthy submits that when the discovery was made by the
petitioner with regard to the materials which were unauthorizedly found at

the proposed BTS site of the BSNL, the petitioner on instruction was asked

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 9 of 16
to file FIR which he filed accordingly on 20.12.2007 implicating the
respondent No.4 as he claimed to be the recipient of the same. Besides
the FIR, the respondent authorities initiated the departmental proceedings
against the respondent No.4 by placing him under suspension on
28.12.2007. Thereafter he was chargesheeted on 23.1.2008 wherein the
petitioner was also asked to depose as the prosecution witness on
10.4.2008. In the enquiry proceeding, the petitioner deposed of the
alleged involvement of the respondent No.4 on the recovered materials.
While such was the stand of the petitioner in the FIR as well as in the
departmental enquiry initiated against the respondent No. 4, the petitioner
on 30.9.2008 submitted his no objection in writing before the CM,
Nagaon stating that he had no objection against the report submitted by
the police in connection with the Nagaon Police Station Case No.978 of
2007 and thereby resulting in the discharge of the respondent No.4.
Therefore, the stand of the petitioner being most contradictory, the
respondent authorities found a prima facie case against him for his
doubtful integrity and unreliable behavior against the interest of the
company attracting Regulation 10(1) of the Regulation. The petitioner’s
reply to the show cause notice not being found satisfactory, a detailed
departmental proceeding was drawn up against him which resulted with

the finding that the charge against the petitioner to be proved.

16. Mr. S Chakraborthy submits that the entire enquiry proceeding
was conducted in a free and fair manner and the petitioner was given all
the opportunity to present his case and therefore the unsubstantiated
stand of the petitioner that the enquiry officer was absolutely biased and
findings perverse is without any basis. He submits that with the discovery

made by the writ petitioner, the FIR was filed on the instruction of the

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 10 of 16
respondent authorities and therefore, the complaint was made on behalf
of the respondents Company. However, the petitioner without consulting
his superiors proceeded to file his no-objection against the Final Report of
the Investigation Officer which resulted in the discharge of the respondent
No.4. Such action/inaction on the part of the writ petitioner is most
unprecedented and against the interest of the company while he being
one of the employee himself. The no-objection submitted by the petitioner
while helping the respondent No.4 to be discharged by the C)M also
clearly indicate the doubtful integrity of the petitioner since his statements
before the enquiry proceeding against the respondent No.4 implicated his
Involvement. Therefore, upon completion of the enquiry and the charge
being proved, the petitioner was duly issued a second show cause notice
giving him another opportunity to show cause as to why the proposed
penalty should not be inflicted upon him. Thereafter, upon consideration
of the reply given by the petitioner, the disciplinary authority decided to
impose the penalty of stoppage of one increment with cumulative effect.
The appeal of the petitioner was also duly considered by the Board and
after taking into account that all the procedures and formalities had been
duly applied before imposition of penalty, the Board found that there was
no ground to interfere with the findings and quantum of the penalty

imposed upon the petitioner and thus upheld the impugned order of

penalty.

17. Mr. S Chakraborhty further submits that unless there is
irregularity committed during the enquiry proceedings or that the findings
of the enquiry officer is perverse and not based on relevant materials,
Court would not interfere with such proceedings and also on the penalty

consequently imposed upon the delinquent officer. He submits that in the

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 11 of 16
instant case as well, the respondent authorities have given all the
opportunity to the petitioner and the enquiry proceeding was conducted
by following the established procedures and norms and therefore no
Interference is called for. He further submits that with regard to the
respondent No.4 being imposed with a lesser penalty, the same is a
different matter altogether in as much as the charge made out against the
petitioner is of his gross negligence of his assigned duty and the
contradictory stand taken by him within a short span of time found to be
in violation of the Regulation of the Company. The charge clearly being
established, there is no scope for drawing up of corollary with the
proceedings against the respondent No.4. He thus submits that under the
facts and circumstances, the writ petition being without merit should be

dismissed.

18. | have heard the learned counsel for the rival parties and |
have perused the materials available on record. Mr. S Chakraborhty has
also produced the relevant records pertaining to the departmental
proceedings and | have also perused the same. The facts which emerged
from the pleadings and contentions of the rival parties is that the FIR was
lodged on 20.12.2007 by the petitioner pursuant to the consultation with
his superiors on the discovery made by him while making a site visit to
the proposed BTS site of the BSNL. The materials which were found at the
site was claimed by the respondent No. 4 as ABADRP materials and that
he was the recipient of the same. The same having been found to be
irregular, FIR was lodged but however after the investigation was
conducted and completed, the learned C)M did not find it fit to proceed
against respondent No. 4 and discharged him from the liability vide order

dated 30.9.2008. The role of the petitioner in the process was his filing of

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 12 of 16
no-objection against the police report filed by the Investigation Officer.
This action of the petitioner was found to be contrary to the deposition he
had made against the departmental enquiry conducted against the
respondent No.4 which led to the issuance of the show cause notice to
him as well. The action of the writ petitioner was found to be in violation
of the Regulation 10(1) since his statements were found to be
contradictory. On perusal of the records produced by Mr. S chakraborhty,
it can be seen that the petitioner had informed the Senior Manager,
Nagaon Electrical Division -| Nagaon on 19.12.2007 that the materials
which were found at the site were of the approximate value of Rs.3,
54,000/- and respondent No.4 apparently was responsible for diverting the
materials and thereby confirmed his involvement in the matter with the ill
motive. It was also stated in the said communication that the materials
have been procured by the respondent No.4 without prior approval and
intimation from the competent authority as was informed by the petitioner

on earlier occasion.

19. Considering the stand of the writ petitioner and the no-objection to
the Final Report submitted before the C) M, the charge framed against the
petitioner can only be the natural outcome of the conduct of the
petitioner. Although the petitioner has maintained that the enquiry
proceedings conducted by the enquiry officer was absolutely bias,
perverse and perfunctory, | find that the same Is only an averment of
routine nature as the petitioner was afforded opportunity for responding
to the steps taken by the disciplinary authority right from the issuance of
the first show cause notice upto the issuance of the ultimate notice upon
the submission of the enquiry report and therefore on the averment that

the proceedings have been vitiated on account of arbitrariness or

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 13 of 16
perversity, in my considered view is not to be found. However, at the
same time, the petitioner having been imposed with a penalty has the
right to ventilate his grievance against the penalty imposed before the
appellate forum which in the instant case is the Board. Regulation 10(8)
and Regulation 10(9) provides that the officer may prefer an appeal
against the order of penalty/penalties specified in the Regulation within a
period of two months from the date of receipt of the order by which the
appellant is aggrieved and thereafter the appeal is to be considered by the
Board on certain parameter including the justification of the findings the
excessiveness of the penalty and Its adequateness etc. Thereafter, the
Board may set aside, reduce, confirm or enhance the penalty or even
remit the case back to the authority for imposition of such penalty as it
may deem fit . A perusal of the said provision clearly indicates that some
responsibilities is cast upon the appellate authority to consider the appeal
before it. In the instant case, the appellate authority i.e. the Board in Its
34"". Board meeting held on 10.12.2010 apparently appears to have
Summarily considered the appeal of the petitioner while rejecting the

same.

20. It may also be noticed herein that the penalties that can be
imposed upon the officer of the establishment are provided in Regulation10(2) (a) wherein amongst the various types of penalties that can be
imposed, ‘stoppage of increment for a specific period’ has been provided
at Regulation 10(2) (a) (ili). However, in the case of the petitioner the
penalty imposed upon him was no doubt stoppage of one year increment
but the same has been made with cumulative effect. While examining the
penalty imposed upon the petitioner, it may not be out of place to notice

the fact that respondent No.4 although proceeded with a separate enquiry

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 14 of 16
proceeding altogether was imposed with the penalty of reduction of pay
by one increment in the existing time scale. The said penalty was
Subsequently restricted or made effective for a period of one year only.
Therefore, it can be seen that the respondent authorities are aware of the
fact that if the penalty of increment is to be withheld, the duration of the

penalty is to be specified in terms of the Regulation aforementioned.

21. The role of the Court as well as the extent to which it is
required to travel while examining the process of departmental
proceedings is well settled. The role of the Court is mainly confined to
examining the decision making process and not the decision itself. Court
iS not prevented from appropriately interfering with such proceeding if the
Same is found to be perverse or the conclusion so reached is not based
upon the relevant materials in the proceedings. As may be noticed, the
departmental proceeding being vitiated due to perversity or irregularities is
not be found in the proceedings drawn up against the petitioner and
therefore, interference on that count would not be called for. However,
upon finding the manner in which the appeal of the petitioner has been
addressed and also the kind of penalties found in the Regulation, | am of
the considered view that the penalty imposed upon the petitioner should
be re-considered by the authority |.e. the Board. It is submitted at the bar
that the petitioner has since retired from service from the post of SubDivisional Engineer while posted at Nagaon on 31.8.2015. Therefore, it
would be only be incumbent upon the Board to examine the appeal of the
petitioner afresh by taking into account the types of penalties provided in
the Regulation at the same time expeditiously since his pension would be

determined on the basis of the outcome of the appeal

WP (C) No. 2948 of 2011 Page 15 of 16
22. Having opined thus, the writ petition is disposed of with a
direction to the respondent No.2 i.e. the Chairman and Managing Director,
APDCL to place the appeal of the petitioner before the Board within a
period of 3(three) weeks from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this
order and the Board shall thereafter consider and dispose the appeal
within a period of 2(two) months from the date of receipt of the appeal
keeping in mind the observation made hereinabove. The decision of the
Board shall be communicated to the petitioner. Petitioner shall also be at
liberty to submit a copy of the writ petition alongwith annexures appended
thereto before the respondent No.2 for consideration of the Board. In the
result, the decision of the Board dismissing the appeal of the petitioner
vide its 34 meeting minutes dated 10.12.2010 is hereby interfered with.

23. It is also made clear that so far as the findings of the enquiry
officer is concerned, the same has not been interfered with but it is the
quantum of the penalty that has been imposed upon the petitioner that Is
to be considered by the Board at Its discretion based upon sound

principles and the Regulation as well.

24. No cost.

the Sonari Municipal Board.

2. It is to be noted that as per the office order dated 11.08.2017, service
of notice by Dasti method upon respondent No.5 had been accepted, but in

Spite of such service of notice, none appears for the respondent No.5.

3. A Notice Inviting Tender was issued by the Sonari Municipal Board for
settlement of amongst others, the daily bazaar cycle stand at Sonari for the

year 2017-18. The last date of receipt of tender was fixed at 1.00 p.m. of

WP(C) No.3535 of 2017 Page 1 of 3
13.03.2017. The petitioner duly participated in the said tender process and he
had quoted a rate of °1,26,400/-. The Government value of the cycle stand as

per the NIT was fixed at ° 78,101/-.

4, In the said tender process, the respondent No.5 who had also
participated, had quoted a rate of ©1,05,510/-. But, however, by the order
dated 01.04.2017, the respondent Sonari Municipal Board had settled the
cycle stand with the respondent No.5. Being aggrieved, the petitioner prefers

this writ petition.

5. The records of the settlement were called for by this Court and as per
the record, the Sonari Municipal Board had taken a decision to award the
settlement of the daily bazaar cycle stand in favour of the respondent No.5 on
the ground that the respondent No.5 is a woman. The said decision was taken

as per resolution dated 30.03.2017.

6. Mr. G. Bakalial, learned counsel for the petitioner relies upon a
decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court rendered in Central Coalfields
Limited and another -vs- SLL-SML (Joint Venture Consortium) and
others, reported in (2016) 8 SCC 622. |n paragraph-36 of the said
judgment, the Hon’ble Supreme Court relies upon one of its earlier decision,
wherein it is provided that every action of the Executive Government must be
informed with reason and should be free from arbitrariness. A further reliance
has been made to the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court rendered in 7e/

reported in (2013) 4 SCC 540, wherein in paragraph 15, it had been held

WP(C) No.3535 of 2017 Page 2 of 3
7. Accordingly, it is the submission of the learned counsel for the
petitioner that the respondent authorities by making the resolution to settle
the cycle stand in question in favour of the respondent No.5 on the ground
that she is a woman is untenable. It is more so, in view of the fact that the
NIT does not anyway indicate that any kind of preference or that an offer of

settlement would be made only to such woman candidates.

8. On a perusal of the NIT, it is noticed that the NIT does not contain any
such clause, which would indicates that the settlement would be made in
favour of a woman by giving preference over any other tenderer irrespective

of the rate that they may quote.

9. In such view of the matter, this Court is of the view that the procedure
adopted by the respondent Sonari Municipal Board violates the principle that
the rules of the game cannot be tinkered after the tender process had began.
In such view of the matter, the settlement order dated 01.04.2017, made in
favour of the respondent No.5 is held to be unsustainable and accordingly the

same Is set aside.

In terms of the above, the writ petition stands disposed of.

petitioners were selected for appointment against the Grade-| post under
the respondent establishment and they joined their respective posts on
13.1.1997, 20.8.1997 and 20.8.1997 respectively. In such case, it can be
legitimately presumed that when a person provides labour or service to
another against receipt of remuneration which is less than the minimum
wage, he is acting under the force of some compulsion which drives him
to work though he is paid less than what he is entitled under the law to

date of their initial joining in the posts and also for payment of their

arrear salaries and benefits entitled to them.

4. The writ petitioners in WP (C) No. 5065 of 2009 were given
call letters for appearing in the interview before the Selection Committee
to be held on 31.10.1995 vide call letters dated 14.10.1995 (Annexure-A,
Al and A2). After going through the selection process through the written
test held on 16.7.1995 and the interview held on 31.10.1995, the
petitioners were selected for appointment against the Grade-| post under
the respondent establishment and they joined their respective posts on
13.1.1997, 20.8.1997 and 20.8.1997 respectively. It is the case of the
petitioners that out of the candidates engaged on and from 1.2.1996,
13.5.1997, eleven candidates were confirmed against their posts but the
petitioners have not been confirmed. The petitioners in fact were
engaged for less than 45 days at a stretch with a basic pay of Rs.2234/per month and an artificial break for two to three days was made
between their engagements after less than 45 days. Although the
petitioners were given their respective employment registration numbers,
they were asked to sign on blank paper and the purpose of which is not

known to them.
5. The writ petitioner in WP (C) No.5068 of 2009 similarly was

appointed by the respondent authorities. However, in his case, his

appointment was by means of a welfare measure since his father retired

WP (C) No. 5065 and 5068 of 2009 Page 3 of 9
in the year 1994 from the respondent corporation. He was appointed to
the Grade-| post in the General Workshop Department on 31.12.1993
with a basic salary of Rs.1040/- per month. He was also similarly
engaged for less than 45 days at a stretch with an artificial break of two

to three days between his engagement.

6. The petitioners approached the respondent authorities to give
them regular appointment and in response to their request, they were
assured that they would soon be given’ regular appointment.
Although the other similarly situated persons were regularized in their
services, the petitioners having not been regularized despite the claim of
the respondent authorities that their names were put up before the

higher authorities for consideration, they are before this Court.

7. Mr. C Baruah, the learned senior counsel for the petitioners
Submits that the petitioners although were duly selected by a regular
process by the respondent authorities, they have been engaged only for
less than 45 days at a stretch with artificial breaks and on fixed pay
which is much less than the amount given to regular employees. The
same is therefore most arbitrary, illegal and whimsical. He submits that
when similarly placed persons can be regularized in their services, there
iS no reason as to why the petitioners should be deprived of such
regularization and the benefit of regular pay scale. In order to
substantiate his argument he relies upon the decision of the Apex Court
rendered in the case of Peoples Union for Democratic Rights & Ors -vsUnion of [naia & Ors reported in (1982) 3 SCC 235. He submits that the
Apex Court in the case under reference has considered as to whether

there is any breach of Article 23 of the Constitution of India when a

WP (C) No. 5065 and 5068 of 2009 Page 4 of 9
person provides labour or service to the State or to any other person and
Is paid less than the minimum wage for it. In such case, it can be
legitimately presumed that when a person provides labour or service to
another against receipt of remuneration which is less than the minimum
wage, he is acting under the force of some compulsion which drives him
to work though he is paid less than what he is entitled under the law to
receive. He would not be in a position to bargain with the employer and
he would have to accept what is offered to him and in doing so, he would
be acting not as a free agent with a choice between the alternative but
under the compulsion of economical circumstances and the labour or
service provided by him would be equal forced labour attracting Article 23
of the Constitution which prohibits forced labour. Thus, he contends that

the Apex Court decided the case in favour of the labourers.

8. Mr. C Baruah, the learned senior counsel further relies upon
the decision of the Apex Court rendered in the case of State of Punjab &
Ors -vs- Jagjit Singh & Ors. reported in 2017 (1) GLT (SC) 47. By
referring to paragraph-55 of the said Judgment, he submits that an
employee engaged for the same work as held by the Apex Court cannot
be paid less than another person who performs the same duties and
responsibilities in a welfare State. Such action besides being demeaning
strikes at the very foundation of human dignity. Anyone who is compelled
to work at a lesser wage does not do so voluntarily. He does so, to
provide food and shelter to the family at the cost of his self respect and
dignity and at the cost of his self worth and at the cost of his integrity.
Thus, the Apex Court held that employee concerned would be entitled to
draw wage at the minimum of the pay scale I.e. at the lowest Grade in

the regular pay scale extended to regular employees holding the same

WP (C) No. 5065 and 5068 of 2009 Page 5 of 9
post. Mr. C Baruah thus submits that considering the decisions rendered
by the Apex Court in the above two cases, the plight of the petitioners
also being similar, the respondent authorities should be directed to
extend similar benefits to the petitioners while regularizing their service in
view of their appointments being routed through regular process and

similarly placed employees having been regularized.

9, Mr. R Dubey, the learned counsel appearing for the respondents
by referring to the affidavit-in-opposition filed on behalf of the
respondents submits that as a part of social measure to provide
employment to the local population, it was decided to employ six
temporary sweepers at Digboi Refinery. Accordingly, six temporary posts
of Sweepers were notified to the Employment Exchange on 7.4.1995 for
recommending suitable candidates. In response to the same, the
Employment Officer at Digboi sponsored 258 names for the posts. All the
candidates were called for the written test and out of which 55
candidates were called for the interview. Based on the criteria that was
adopted, the Selection Committee recommended 17 names _ for
appointment of temporary Sweepers in order of merit wherein the names
of the petitioners in WP (C) No. 5065 of 2009 figured at Serial No. 6, 9
and 8 in order of merit amongst the nine persons recommended for
appointment. He submits that as can been seen from the form of
notification of vacancies, the nature of the employment was clearly
shown to be temporary and accordingly the petitioners were engaged for
Specific period which was less than 45 days. As set out in their
engagement letter, the petitioners were made known of the nature of
their engagement and to which, as a token of acceptance, they had duly

subscribed their signatures. In such event, the petitioners cannot have a

WP (C) No. 5065 and 5068 of 2009 Page 6 of 9
legitimate claim for appointment on regular basis under the respondent
authorities. In so far as the salary of the petitioners are concerned, he
Submits that their respective salaries have been enhanced from time to
time and in fact besides their salaries, the petitioners have been given
other benefits and allowances which can be clearly seen from their
respective pay slips that has been annexed to the affidavit-in-opposition.
As for the decisions rendered upon by the learned counsel for the
petitioners, he submits that the petitioners are in fact getting more pay
than what has been held to be entitled in the case of J agjit Singh & Ors.

(Supra).

10. | have considered the submissions advanced by the learned
counsel for the rival parties and | have perused the materials available on
record. The two issues which in fact are the prayer of the writ petitioners
which requires consideration is as to whether the petitioners have the
right to be regularized in service and secondly if not, whether they are
entitled to similar salary given to the regular employees under the

establishment of the respondents.

11. As can be seen from the affidavit-in-opposition filed by the
respondents, the nature of employment notice issued by the Employment
Exchange indicates that posts sought to be filled up were temporary
posts. As regards the pay and allowances, a certain scale of pay has been
indicated in the notice of employment. Although due process was
undertaken in selecting eligible candidates for the Grade-| post (Sweeper)
under the establishment of the respondents, the same cannot by itself
give the petitioners a right to claim regularization. The manner in which

the concerned post is to be filled up is to be only decided by the

WP (C) No. 5065 and 5068 of 2009 Page 7 of 9
employer by giving due intimation to the aspiring applicant for the posts.
The same would however have to be in terms of the relevant policy,
guidelines or rules for that matter. In the instant case as well, the
petitioners apparently have not been kept in dark about the nature of the
appointment and for which reasons, | am of the considered view that
regularization as claimed by the petitioners cannot be as a matter of right
but however the respondent authorities having undertaken some process
in regularizing a few of the appointees would be at liberty to consider

regularization of the petitioners.

12. As regards the pay and allowances of the petitioners, the
employment notice clearly reveals that a certain pay scale was prescribed
for the posts and going by the submissions of the learned counsel for the
respondents, pay and allowances given to them have been enhanced
from time to time. Admittedly, the respondents are engaging employees
on regular pay scale and another set of employees such as the petitioners
on a certain pay scale which presumably is lower than the regular scale.
Considering the decision of the Apex Court in the case of Jagjit Singh
(Supra) as well as Peoples Union for Democratic Rights & Ors (supra), |
am of the considered opinion that the ratio laid down in the above two
cases would cover the case of the petitioners. The petitioners in short are
entitled to draw their wages at the minimum of the pay scale at the
lowest minimum wage in the regular pay scale extended to regular
employees holding similar posts. If the same works out to more than
what they are being currently paid the amount which ts higher shall be

paid to the petitoners. It is ordered accordingly.

stands allowed to the extent as indicated above. No cost.

| UDGMENT AND ORDER (ORAL)

Heard Mr. H Das, the learned counsel for the petitioner and Dr. B
Ahmed, the learned counsel for the respondent Nos. 1 to 4. Also heard
Mr. R Borpujari, the learned counsel ap for the respondent No.5. None

appears for the respondent No.6.

2. The controversy involved in the present writ petition is that the
petitioner being the senior most Junior Assistant working under the
establishment of respondent No.4 was not promoted to the post of Senior
Assistant under the said establishment admittedly on the ground that a
promotional post which was considered by the Selection Committee in the
year 2015 has been found earmarked for ST(P) candidate as per 100
point roster. Respondent No.5 being an SI(P) candidate was thus

promoted to the post.

3. Mr. H Das, the learned counsel for the petitioner submits that
the respondent No.5 in fact although appointed as Khalasi initially was
promoted to the post of J unior Assistant on 28.1.2009 after being given a
preference as an ST(P) candidate in terms of the roster maintained by
the respondent authorities. He submits that since preference was already
given to the respondent No.5, she could not have been conferred similar
benefit for the second time when consideration was made in the year
2015 for promotion from the post of J unior Assistant to Senior Assistant.
He further submits that the petitioner would attain the age of

Superannuation in the year 2020 whereas the respondent No.5 is due to

WP (C) No. 5087 of 2015 Page 2 of 6
Superannuate only in the year 2032. Therefore, even on this count, the

petitioner ought to have been given the preference of promotion.

4. Dr. B Ahmed, the learned Standing Counsel, | rrigation Department
on the other hand submits that the respondent authorities have only
gone by the 100 point roster reservation. Since, the slot in the roster
point register was meant for ST(P) candidate, respondent No.5 being an
ST(P) was therefore given the promotion. He further submits that there is
no bar in giving promotion to respondent No.5 for the second time since

the post incidentally happened to be reserved for ST(P) candidate.

5. Mr. H Das, the learned counsel for the petitioner submits that as
can be seen from the communication dated 2.5.2015 (Annexure-Vl)
made by the respondent No.3 to the respondent No.2, one post of Senior
Assistant was lying vacant since 1.5.2015 due to the promotion of one Sri
Jagadish Roy to the post of Head Assistant. Accordingly, the respondent
No.3 submitted a proposal for filling up the post by enclosing the
gradation list of J unior Assistants with names including the petitioner and
the respondent No.6. As per the gradation list, petitioner was shown to
be seniormost and he and the respondent No.6 were the only applicants
for the promotional post of Senior Assistants under establishment. Mr. H
Das submits that the petitioner joined the post of Junior Assistant on
1.3.2006 wherein the respondent No.6 joined her post of J unior Assistant
on 13.2.2009 and therefore the petitioner ought to have been promoted
to the post of Senior Assistant. He further submits that when there is only
one post available for being filled up by way of promotion, no reservation

can be made.

WP (C) No. 5087 of 2015 Page 3 of 6
6. In support of his submission, he places his reliance upon the
decision of this Court in the case of /aya /aswal Singh -vs- State of
Andhra Pradesh & Ors. reported in (2012) 3 GLT 31.

7. In the said decision, a further reliance has been made to the
Apex Court rendered in Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and
Research, Chandigarh -vs- Faculty Assocation & Ors. reported in (1998)
4 SCC 1 amongst others wherein it has been held that in a single cadre
post, reservation at any point of time on account of rotation of roster is
bound to bring about a situation where such a single post in the cadre
will be kept reserved exclusively for the members of backward class and
in total exclusion of the general members of the public. Such total
exclusion of general members of the public and cent percent reservation
for the backward class is not permissible within the constitutional frame
work. He therefore submits that since there was only one vacant post to
be filled up since 1.5.2015, the same could not have been reserved and
filled up by promoting the respondent No.6 who belongs to the ST (P)
category. Therefore, under the circumstances, he submits that the
promotion of the respondent No.6 should be set aside and in her place,

the petitioner should be promoted.

8. | have considered the submissions advanced by the learned
counsel for the parties and | have perused the materials available on

record.
9, In order to provide reservation to the reserved category of

Schedule Caste and Schedule Tribe in the State, the State Government

framed the Assam Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Reservation

WP (C) No. 5087 of 2015 Page 4 of 6
of Vacancies in Services and Posts) Act, 1978 which was further
amended by the Amendment Act of 2012. As per the said provision for
reservation and its amendment, 20/100 point roster has been provided
and according to the roster register maintained by the Department,
roster point No.5 is meant for ST(P) and therefore respondent No.6
being an ST(P) was recommended for the post. It may be noticed that as
regard the seniority position, there is no doubt the petitioner is senior to
the respondent No.6. With regard to the decision relied upon by the Mr.
H Das i.e. the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research,
Chandigarh (supra), the same was in relation to a single post cadre,
reservation of which could result in a situation where such single post in
the cadre will remain reserved exclusively for the members of the
backward class and to the exclusion of the member of the general
category. However, in the instant case, the case is not that of there
being only a single post in the cadre and the reservation thereof would
exclude the general category candidates from being promoted to the
post. From what can be noticed is that the 100 point roster provides for
filling up of the post from various categories against their prescribed
Slots and therefore, the authority relied upon by Mr. H Das cannot be
applied to the instant case. The respondent No.6 may have earned her
promotion in the post of Junior Assistant earlier by virtue of being an
ST(P). However, that by itself cannot be a ground for not extending her
the benefit of reservation since the roster point No.5 has been reserved
for ST (P) candidate. It can only be seen that such promotion in service
by availing the reservation is only incidental. Therefore, | am of the
considered opinion that the promotion given to the respondent No.6 as
per the reservation in the 100 point roster in the absence of any material

to the contrary do not call for the interference of this Court.

No. KDP.137/MSDP.PROPOSAL/2012/Pt.1/86 dated 08.10.2014, the

4. According to the Notification No.
KDP.137/MSDP.PROPOSAL/2012/Pt.1/86 dated 08.10.2014 under the
signature of the respondent No.3, a Block Level Committee for the Minority
Concentration Block for the Sub-Divisional Block, Hajo was constituted. In the

Said constitution of the Board, the names of the petitioners were included.

5. In this writ petition, the petitioners are aggrieved by the subsequent
Notification dated 26.08.2016 of the Secretary to the Govt. of Assam, Welfare
of Minorities and Development Department, by which the authorities were
pleased to dissolve the various Sub-Divisional Minorities Board including the
Board at Hajo, which is situated at Kamrup(Rural). Being aggrieved by the
Said dissolution and the constitution of the subsequent Board by the
Notification dated 08.09.2016 of the Deputy Commissioner, Kamrup(R), this

writ petition had been preferred.
6. One of the issues raised in this writ petition is that the earlier Board
which was constituted, including the petitioners, was dissolved without

following the Principles of Natural J ustice.

7. | The respondent authorities, on the other hand, takes a stand that the
dissolution and constitution of the Minorities Development Board is within the
realm of the Doctrine of Pleasure for the State respondent authorities, and, as
such, no hearing is required to be provided to the members of the earlier

Board which stood dissolved.

8. But in this respect, the learned counsel for the petitioners makes a
reference to the decision of the Division Bench of this Court rendered in Sub
Divisional Welfare Boards For Scheduled Tribes & Ors. Vs. State of Assam &
Ors., reported in 2017(2)GLT 437. |n the said decision before the learned
Division Bench, the issue involved was as to whether the dissolution and
constitution of the Sub-Divisional Welfare Board for Scheduled Tribe was
within the realm of the Doctrine of Pleasure for the State respondent
authorities and also as to whether any incumbent member whose Board stood

dissolved is entitled to opportunity of hearing or not.

9. In paragraph 12 of the aforesaid judgment of the learned Division
Bench, it has been held that the Principles of Doctrine of Pleasure is not
applicable in the said case before the learned Division Bench, meaning thereof
is that the dissolution and constitution of the Sub-Divisional Welfare Board for
Scheduled Tribes is not within the realm of Doctrine of Pleasure for the State

respondent authorities.

10. Accordingly, in paragraph 9, it has been held that the actions of the
Government in dissolving the Board is illegal, inasmuch as, there is a violation

of the Principles of Natural J ustice.

11. The learned Division Bench also arrives at a conclusion that none of the

members of the Boards dissolved were given an opportunity of hearing to
convince that there was a smooth functioning of the Central and State sector

Schemes for the development of the Scheduled Tribes.

12. Inthe instant case, it is an admitted position of the parties that before
dissolving of the Board, of which the petitioners were members, no
Opportunities of hearing were given. Accordingly, by following the aforesaid
decision of the Division Bench, this Court is of the view that the Notification
dated 26.08.2016, so far as it pertains to the Kamrup(R) at SI.46, and the
Subsequent Notification dated 08.09.2016 of the Deputy Commissioner,

Kamrup(R), are accordingly, declared to be illegal and are set aside.

13. As provided in the Division Bench, the dissolved Board which was
constituted by the earlier Notification dated 08.10.2014, stands restored with

immediate effect.

14. At this stage, Mr. N Anand, learned counsel for respondent Nos.5 and 6
makes a submission that the aforesaid decision may not be a bar on the State
respondent authorities to proceed in the matter, if so advised by following due
procedure of law. As the interference has been made on the premises that no
Opportunity of hearing is given, liberty is granted to the respondent

authorities to proceed, as per law, if so advised.

15. Interms of the above, this writ petition stands disposed of.

Concentration Block for the Sub-Divisional Block, Hajo was constituted. In the

Said constitution of the Board, the names of the petitioners were included.

5. In this writ petition, the petitioners are aggrieved by the subsequent
Notification dated 26.08.2016 of the Secretary to the Govt. of Assam, Welfare
of Minorities and Development Department, by which the authorities were
pleased to dissolve the various Sub-Divisional Minorities Board including the
Board at Hajo, which is situated at Kamrup(Rural). Being aggrieved by the
Said dissolution and the constitution of the subsequent Board by the
Notification dated 08.09.2016 of the Deputy Commissioner, Kamrup(R), this

writ petition had been preferred.
6. One of the issues raised in this writ petition is that the earlier Board
which was constituted, including the petitioners, was dissolved without

following the Principles of Natural J ustice.

7. | The respondent authorities, on the other hand, takes a stand that the
dissolution and constitution of the Minorities Development Board is within the
realm of the Doctrine of Pleasure for the State respondent authorities, and, as
such, no hearing is required to be provided to the members of the earlier

Board which stood dissolved.

8. But in this respect, the learned counsel for the petitioners makes a
reference to the decision of the Division Bench of this Court rendered in Sub
Divisional Welfare Boards For Scheduled Tribes & Ors. Vs. State of Assam &
Ors., reported in 2017(2)GLT 437. |n the said decision before the learned
Division Bench, the issue involved was as to whether the dissolution and
constitution of the Sub-Divisional Welfare Board for Scheduled Tribe was
within the realm of the Doctrine of Pleasure for the State respondent
authorities and also as to whether any incumbent member whose Board stood

dissolved is entitled to opportunity of hearing or not.

9. In paragraph 12 of the aforesaid judgment of the learned Division
Bench, it has been held that the Principles of Doctrine of Pleasure is not
applicable in the said case before the learned Division Bench, meaning thereof
is that the dissolution and constitution of the Sub-Divisional Welfare Board for
Scheduled Tribes is not within the realm of Doctrine of Pleasure for the State

respondent authorities.

10. Accordingly, in paragraph 9, it has been held that the actions of the
Government in dissolving the Board is illegal, inasmuch as, there is a violation

of the Principles of Natural J ustice.

11. The learned Division Bench also arrives at a conclusion that none of the

members of the Boards dissolved were given an opportunity of hearing to
convince that there was a smooth functioning of the Central and State sector

Schemes for the development of the Scheduled Tribes.

12. Inthe instant case, it is an admitted position of the parties that before
dissolving of the Board, of which the petitioners were members, no
Opportunities of hearing were given. Accordingly, by following the aforesaid
decision of the Division Bench, this Court is of the view that the Notification
dated 26.08.2016, so far as it pertains to the Kamrup(R) at SI.46, and the
Subsequent Notification dated 08.09.2016 of the Deputy Commissioner,

Kamrup(R), are accordingly, declared to be illegal and are set aside.

13. As provided in the Division Bench, the dissolved Board which was
constituted by the earlier Notification dated 08.10.2014, stands restored with

immediate effect.

14. At this stage, Mr. N Anand, learned counsel for respondent Nos.5 and 6
makes a submission that the aforesaid decision may not be a bar on the State
respondent authorities to proceed in the matter, if so advised by following due
procedure of law. As the interference has been made on the premises that no
Opportunity of hearing is given, liberty is granted to the respondent

authorities to proceed, as per law, if so advised.

15. Interms of the above, this writ petition stands disposed of.

Heard Mr. F Khan, the learned counsel for the petitioners as well
as Mr. MR Adhikari, the learned Government Advocate for all the
respondents except respondent No.2. The Respondent No. 2 I.e. Finance

Department is represented by Mr. B Gogoi, the learned counsel.

2. This is a second round writ petition filed by the petitioner. The
earlier writ petition being WP (C) No.4435 of 2000 was disposed of vide
order dated 5.9.2002 (Annexure-11) whereby the grievance of the
petitioners was directed to be examined by the respondent authorities
asking them to take a decision and convey the same to the petitioners.
Despite the direction, grievance of the petitioners have not been
mitigated, the petitioners are again before this Court through the instant

writ proceeding.

3. The brief facts for disposal of the present writ petition may be
narrated.
A. The petitioners were appointed as Agricultural Demonstrators in

the year 1990 in the pay scale of Rs.490-840/-. It may be noted that the
petitioners have the qualification of HSSLC as well as Diploma in
Agricultural Engineering. The Revision of Pay Rules, 1990 which was
issued on 6.12.1990 revised the pay scale to Rs.1125-2215. However,

despite the revision, since the counterparts of the petitioners having

WP (C) No. 5466 of 2017 Page 2 of 6
Diploma in the Agricultural Engineering in the Department of Agriculture
were getting pre-revised pay scale of Rs.620/- -1315/- which was revised
to Rs. 1375-3375, the petitioners by submitting a representation on
17.6.1991 to the respondent authorities sought appropriate revision of
pay similar to their counterparts. But the Pay revision was not accorded
to the petitioners and soon after the pay revision of 1998 were enforced,
the petitioners again prayed for corresponding revision of their pay Scale
from 620-1315 to Rs.3580-8750. The demand of the petitioners for pay
revision was ultimately considered by the Assam Pay Commission of 2008
whereby the case of the petitioners were examined individually and
consequently recommended to be placed in the pay Band -2 with Grade
Pay of Rs.2800/-. It was also indicated that the same may be treated as
terminal pay and as and when the post fall vacant in future, the same
may be filled up from Agriculture Department. It may also be noted
herein that the revision of pay in respect of the petitioners were made
personally in view of the fact that they were holder of Diploma in
Engineering for which other Departments were getting higher Pay scale
than what was actually given to the petitioners while working under the
establishment of Inspector General of Prisons of the Home Department
as the Administrative Department. Non-implementation of the said
recommendation and appropriate conversion of the same as per the 7""
Pay Commission has led the petitioner to approach this Court again

through the instant writ petition.

5. The writ petitioners in their additional affidavit filed on 8.4.2016
have annexed a communication made to the Deputy Secretary to the
Government of Assam, Home Department (B) by the Inspector General of
Prisons vide Memo No. PRI-102/96/32 dated 24.9.2010 wherein the

WP (C) No. 5466 of 2017 Page 3 of 6
recommendation of the Assam Pay Commission, 2008 in respect of the
Agriculture Demonstrators with the petitioners as incumbents amongst
others have been duly examined and thereafter found to be justified and

recommended.

6. Mr. F Khan appearing for the petitioners submits that since the
Home Department is the Administrative Department at the Government
level, it is for the Home Department to act upon the recommendation
Submitted by the Inspector General of Prisons and admittedly such

exercise has not been carried out by the Home Department till date.

7. Mr. MR Adhikari by referring to the affidavit-in-opposition filed
by the respondent No.1 submits that the recommendation of the Pay
Commission becomes binding and final in the matters of pay and
allowance etc. if the same is accepted by the State Government in the
Finance Department and the petitioners are also eligible to get their pay
and allowances as per the recommendation of 7° Pay Commission is

accepted by the State Government in the Finance Department.

8. Appearing for the Finance Department, Mr. B Gogoi submits that
so far as the instructions are concerned, the Finance Department has not
received any proposal in respect of the petitioners from the Home
Department to examine the recommendation of the Assam Pay
Commission, 2008. He therefore submits that if such proposal is sent by
the Home Department, Finance Department would definitely examine the

matter.

WP (C) No. 5466 of 2017 Page 4 of 6
9, | have considered the submission advanced by the rival parties
and | have perused the materials available on record. The Assam Pay
Commission, 2008 has indeed considered the revision of pay in respect of
the writ petitioners and in consequence thereof, the Inspector General of
Prisons undertook a detailed examination of the said recommendation in
respect of the claim of the petitioners amongst others and on 24.9.2010,
a communication has been made to the Deputy Secretary to the
Government of Assam, Home (B) Department. From the affidavit filed by
the respondent No.1, it cannot be made out as to whether the proposal
has been received by the Home Department was so that the same can be
forwarded to the Finance Department for its examination. Therefore,
considering the fact that the grievance of the petitioners has been
adequately considered in so far as the Assam Pay Commission and the
Home, Prisons Department are concerned, what remains is that the

proposal has to be forwarded to the Finance Department.

10. In that view of the matter, the writ petition is disposed of with a
direction to the Commissioner and Secretary to the Government of
Assam, Home (B) Department (Respondent No.1) to forward the proposal
of the recommendation of the Assam Pay Commission, 2008 along with
the Home Department’s proposal with the communication dated
24.9.2010 made by the Inspector General of Prisons to the Secretary to
the Government of Assam, Finance Department (respondent No.2) if not
already done within a period of one month from the date of receipt of a
certified copy of this order. Upon receipt of the communication, the
Finance Department shall consider the proposal in the light of the
recommendation of the Assam Pay Commission, 2008 as well as the

justification and recommendation made by the Home Department and the

WP (C) No. 5466 of 2017 Page 5 of 6
Inspector General of Prisons and take a decision as early as possible
preferably within the outer limit of 3 months from the date of receipt of
the communication from the Home Department. The communication of
the Home Department to the Finance Department as well as the outcome
and decision of the Finance Department shall be communicated to the

petitioners .

11. It is further observed herein that if the recommendation of the
Pay Commission is found to be acceptable and accorded to the petitioner,
authorities concerned may consider taking care of the arrears that may

be found to be entitled to the petitioners as per law.

Page 1 of 7
2. The petitioner is aggrieved with the deduction of the medical
expenses he incurred for his treatment from his salary amounting to
Rs.94,436/-.

3. The facts of the case may be briefly be narrated. The petitioner
was appointed as Storekeeper Technician under the Border Roads Task
Force (General Reserve Engineering Force) under Unit HQ 73 RCC of Army
on 28.12.87. In the year 2007, while the petitioner was at HQ 101 RCC,
he suffered from brain hemorrhage and for which he was admitted to the
MI Room 141 DMC. Considering the condition of the petitioner, the
authorities shifted the petitioner to Gurunanak Government Hospital where
he was admitted in the Intensive Care Unit. After conducting necessary
investigation, the authorities found that the petitioner should be shifted to
a hospital where proper treatment could be given to him. The family
members of the petitioner therefore admitted the petitioner in Ajit Hospital
in Amritsar after being released from the Gurunanak Government Hospital.
Ajit Hospital prepared a draft estimate of Rs.1, 27,725/- for his treatment
and the authorities concerned considering the emergent situation,
sanctioned an amount of Rs.1,14,900/- to take care of the emergent
requirement for the petitioner’s treatment. Consequently, the petitioner
underwent an operation which has been termed in the Discharge
Summary dated §8.2.2007 “Emergency right sided sub-occipital
craniectomy and evacuation of noht cerebellar haematoma’. The
Discharge Summary shows that the petitioner was admitted on 25.1.2007
and the operation was performed on the same day and thereafter, he was
discharged on 8.2.2007.

WP (C) No. 5466 of 2017 Page 2 of 7
4. The petitioner after being his discharged and upon recovery
joined his duty and submitted the entire medical bills amounting to
Rs.1,29,186 to the authorities concerned for their approval and payment.
However, while the petitioner was expecting reimbursement of the entire
amount, the audit authority of 49 TF passed the bill only for an amount of
Rs.29,049/- out of the total amount of Rs.1,29,186 submitted by the
petitioner on the ground that an amount of Rs.1,14,900 had already been
sanctioned and paid as advance Further, the amount of Rs.29,049/having been calculated towards the entitlement of the petitioner for
medical reimbursement, an amount of Rs.98,676/- was shown as a debit
against the account of the petitioner for recovery (Annexure-D). According
to the petitioner, the recovery of the aforesaid amount was made from the
August, 2009 and the petitioner was only paid monthly salary of Rs.4000/.
Being aggrieved, the petitioner filed a representation to the authorities on
15.2.2010. But however, vide communication dated 23.2.2010 (AnnexureE), the petitioner was informed that the amount claimed by the petitioner
was not agreed upon by the audit authorities and that the matter was
being referred to the higher authority for further instruction. Thereafter,
the respondent authorities having not attended to the claim of the
petitioner, he again filed a representation before the authorities on
4.3.2010(Annexure-F). The same having not been considered, the

petitioner is before this Court.

5. Mr. JH Saikia, the learned counsel for the petitioner submits that
the ailment of the petitioner was not foreseen and his suffering from brain
hemorrhage could not have been anticipated and it happened all of a
sudden requiring immediate emergency treatment in a hospital having

the required infrastructure. Although the petitioner was admitted to the

WP (C) No. 5466 of 2017 Page 3 of 7
Unit Ml Room 141 DMC, he had to be immediately shifted to Gurunanak
Government Hospital wherein, upon making the necessary investigation
including MRI, the petitioner was found to have brain hemorrhage. Since,
Gurunanak Government Hospital was not having the infrastructure for his
treatment, the petitioner had to be shifted to Ajit Hospital in Amristar
where the petitioner could be attended to appropriately and operation
performed. It was therefore because of such emergency that the
petitioner undertook the operation at Ajit Hospital. In the given
circumstance, the petitioner was not in a position to make a preference of
the Hospital where he could be treated. Therefore whatever medical
expenses which was incurred by him should be reimbursed by his
employer. Mr. JH Saikia in this connection relies upon the decision of the
Apex Court rendered in the case of Suman Rakheja -vs- The State of
Haryana reported in 2004 (13) SCC 562. He submits that considering the
urgency in which the patient in that case had to be immediately admitted
in an hospital , there was no time for him to be shifted in a Hospital which
was a Government approved hospital and upon being treated in a private
Hospital, the Apex Court held that the petitioner therein was entitled
100% medical expenses reimbursement in the rate of AllMS and whatever
excess expenditure that was incurred by the petitioner, he would be

entitled to 75 % of the same.

6. Mr. JH Saikia therefore submits that the petitioner in the instant
case similar to the case of Suman Rakheja (supra) suffered from Brain
Hemorrhage and for which he had to be immediately operated upon. That
the petitioner in fact on the day of admission itself was operated upon at
Ajit Hospital and therefore in such a situation, similar relief should be

granted to the petitioner and whatever amount that was spent for his

WP (C) No. 5466 of 2017 Page 4 of 7
treatment should be reimbursed by the respondent authorities. He thus
Submits that the amount which has been deducted from the salary i.e.
Rs.98,676/- should be refunded to him.

7. Mr. M Phukan, the learned CGC appearing for the respondents
Submits that as the petitioner is an employee of the Border Roads Task
Force (General Reserve Engineering Force) his entitlement towards the
medical re-imbursement is covered by the Central Government Medical
Attendance Rule, 1944. By referring to Appendix-VIIl of the said Rules, he
Submits that the permissible ceiling for taking treatment in a private
medical institution has been provided for and accordingly, in the case of
the petitioner, considering the emergent situation, a sum of Rs.1,14,900/was sanctioned and deposited in the hospital as advance. The petitioner
thereafter upon being discharged from the hospital, submitted a bill
amounting to Rs.1,29,186/-which on calculation as per approved rates
provided by the Rules, an amount of Rs.94,436/- was found to be
recoverable from the petitioner as it was the excess amount besides what
he was entitled to under the Rules. He therefore submits that as the
recovery of the excess amount from the petitioner is in accordance with
the Rules and as per the permissible limit, the petitioner cannot have any

claim for the medical reimbursement.

8. Mr. M Phukan by referring to the Discharge-cum-Follow Up card
issued by the Government Medical College Hospital at Amritsar which he
has produced submits that the petitioner upon being diagnosed with brain
hemorrhage was advised to go for neuro surgery since such facility was
not available in the said hospital. The petitioner was referred for such
treatment with the choice of PGIMER, Chandigarh or AIIMS Hospital.

WP (C) No. 5466 of 2017 Page 5 of 7
However, the petitioner on his own decided to take the treatment from
Ajit Hospital in Amritsar. Therefore, under such circumstance, the
respondent authorities have decided to grant him medical reimbursement
in terms of the relevant rules and for which the petitioner cannot have any

grievance.

9. | have considered the submissions advanced by the rival parties
and | have perused the pleadings as well as the records produced by the
learned CGC.

10. The petitioner in his writ petition has made a representation
that his ailment of suffering brain hemorrhage was emergency and for
which immediate medical attention was required. The undisputed fact Is
that Unit Hospital was not equipped to attend his ailment. Furthermore,
the Gurunanak Government Hospital at Amritsar also does not have the
facilities for performing neoru surgery. That is why the petitioner was
referred to other hospitals having such facilities. No doubt, the petitioner
was given a choice of PGIMER, Chandigarh and AIIMS Hospital for
undertaking neuro surgery but nevertheless, to strictly abide by the advice
at the relevant time, considering the condition of the petitioner, the choice
of the petitioner and his relatives to go for the surgery at Ajit Hospital
cannot be faulted with. Court is also not unmindful about the situation
that may have prevailed at the relevant moment. Discretion in such
emergency ordinarily is best to be left with the patient and his relatives
present at that time. However, considering the fact that the petitioner is
an employee of BFIF which is governed by its own Rules, a departure
from the Rules would also be not the most appropriate step that can be

taken. However, what transpired at the relevant time was that the

WP (C) No. 5466 of 2017 Page 6 of 7
petitioner was in requirement of immediate neuro surgery and therefore
considering the case of Suman Rakheja_ (supra), | find the same
applicable to the case of the instant writ petitioner. Therefore, | am of the

considered opinion that he is entitled to similar relief.

11. In that view of the matter, the writ petition is disposed of in
line with the case of Suman Rakheja_ (supra). The petitioner shall be
entitled to 100% medical expenses in the rate of AllIMS, New Delhi and
also 75 % of the expenditure in excess thereto. The petitioner has
contended that recovery has been made from his monthly salary from the
month of August, 2009 and the respondent authorities probably have
recovered the entire amount by now. The amount recovered from the writ
petitioner therefore will be refunded to him through his Bank Account
after making necessary adjustment in terms of the observation made
above. Such exercise shall be carried out within a month from the date of

receipt of a certified copy of this order.

12. Writ petition is accordingly disposed of. No cost.

MI Room 141 DMC. Considering the condition of the petitioner, the
authorities shifted the petitioner to Gurunanak Government Hospital where
he was admitted in the Intensive Care Unit. After conducting necessary
investigation, the authorities found that the petitioner should be shifted to
a hospital where proper treatment could be given to him. The family
members of the petitioner therefore admitted the petitioner in Ajit Hospital
in Amritsar after being released from the Gurunanak Government Hospital.
Ajit Hospital prepared a draft estimate of Rs.1, 27,725/- for his treatment
and the authorities concerned considering the emergent situation,
sanctioned an amount of Rs.1,14,900/- to take care of the emergent
requirement for the petitioner’s treatment. Consequently, the petitioner
underwent an operation which has been termed in the Discharge
Summary dated §8.2.2007 “Emergency right sided sub-occipital
craniectomy and evacuation of noht cerebellar haematoma’. The
Discharge Summary shows that the petitioner was admitted on 25.1.2007
and the operation was performed on the same day and thereafter, he was
discharged on 8.2.2007.

WP (C) No. 5466 of 2017 Page 2 of 7
4. The petitioner after being his discharged and upon recovery
joined his duty and submitted the entire medical bills amounting to
Rs.1,29,186 to the authorities concerned for their approval and payment.
However, while the petitioner was expecting reimbursement of the entire
amount, the audit authority of 49 TF passed the bill only for an amount of
Rs.29,049/- out of the total amount of Rs.1,29,186 submitted by the
petitioner on the ground that an amount of Rs.1,14,900 had already been
sanctioned and paid as advance Further, the amount of Rs.29,049/having been calculated towards the entitlement of the petitioner for
medical reimbursement, an amount of Rs.98,676/- was shown as a debit
against the account of the petitioner for recovery (Annexure-D). According
to the petitioner, the recovery of the aforesaid amount was made from the
August, 2009 and the petitioner was only paid monthly salary of Rs.4000/.
Being aggrieved, the petitioner filed a representation to the authorities on
15.2.2010. But however, vide communication dated 23.2.2010 (AnnexureE), the petitioner was informed that the amount claimed by the petitioner
was not agreed upon by the audit authorities and that the matter was
being referred to the higher authority for further instruction. Thereafter,
the respondent authorities having not attended to the claim of the
petitioner, he again filed a representation before the authorities on
4.3.2010(Annexure-F). The same having not been considered, the

petitioner is before this Court.

5. Mr. JH Saikia, the learned counsel for the petitioner submits that
the ailment of the petitioner was not foreseen and his suffering from brain
hemorrhage could not have been anticipated and it happened all of a
sudden requiring immediate emergency treatment in a hospital having

the required infrastructure. Although the petitioner was admitted to the

WP (C) No. 5466 of 2017 Page 3 of 7
Unit Ml Room 141 DMC, he had to be immediately shifted to Gurunanak
Government Hospital wherein, upon making the necessary investigation
including MRI, the petitioner was found to have brain hemorrhage. Since,
Gurunanak Government Hospital was not having the infrastructure for his
treatment, the petitioner had to be shifted to Ajit Hospital in Amristar
where the petitioner could be attended to appropriately and operation
performed. It was therefore because of such emergency that the
petitioner undertook the operation at Ajit Hospital. In the given
circumstance, the petitioner was not in a position to make a preference of
the Hospital where he could be treated. Therefore whatever medical
expenses which was incurred by him should be reimbursed by his
employer. Mr. JH Saikia in this connection relies upon the decision of the
Apex Court rendered in the case of Suman Rakheja -vs- The State of
Haryana reported in 2004 (13) SCC 562. He submits that considering the
urgency in which the patient in that case had to be immediately admitted
in an hospital , there was no time for him to be shifted in a Hospital which
was a Government approved hospital and upon being treated in a private
Hospital, the Apex Court held that the petitioner therein was entitled
100% medical expenses reimbursement in the rate of AllMS and whatever
excess expenditure that was incurred by the petitioner, he would be

entitled to 75 % of the same.

6. Mr. JH Saikia therefore submits that the petitioner in the instant
case similar to the case of Suman Rakheja (supra) suffered from Brain
Hemorrhage and for which he had to be immediately operated upon. That
the petitioner in fact on the day of admission itself was operated upon at
Ajit Hospital and therefore in such a situation, similar relief should be

granted to the petitioner and whatever amount that was spent for his

WP (C) No. 5466 of 2017 Page 4 of 7
treatment should be reimbursed by the respondent authorities. He thus
Submits that the amount which has been deducted from the salary i.e.
Rs.98,676/- should be refunded to him.

7. Mr. M Phukan, the learned CGC appearing for the respondents
Submits that as the petitioner is an employee of the Border Roads Task
Force (General Reserve Engineering Force) his entitlement towards the
medical re-imbursement is covered by the Central Government Medical
Attendance Rule, 1944. By referring to Appendix-VIIl of the said Rules, he
Submits that the permissible ceiling for taking treatment in a private
medical institution has been provided for and accordingly, in the case of
the petitioner, considering the emergent situation, a sum of Rs.1,14,900/was sanctioned and deposited in the hospital as advance. The petitioner
thereafter upon being discharged from the hospital, submitted a bill
amounting to Rs.1,29,186/-which on calculation as per approved rates
provided by the Rules, an amount of Rs.94,436/- was found to be
recoverable from the petitioner as it was the excess amount besides what
he was entitled to under the Rules. He therefore submits that as the
recovery of the excess amount from the petitioner is in accordance with
the Rules and as per the permissible limit, the petitioner cannot have any

claim for the medical reimbursement.

8. Mr. M Phukan by referring to the Discharge-cum-Follow Up card
issued by the Government Medical College Hospital at Amritsar which he
has produced submits that the petitioner upon being diagnosed with brain
hemorrhage was advised to go for neuro surgery since such facility was
not available in the said hospital. The petitioner was referred for such
treatment with the choice of PGIMER, Chandigarh or AIIMS Hospital.

WP (C) No. 5466 of 2017 Page 5 of 7
However, the petitioner on his own decided to take the treatment from
Ajit Hospital in Amritsar. Therefore, under such circumstance, the
respondent authorities have decided to grant him medical reimbursement
in terms of the relevant rules and for which the petitioner cannot have any

grievance.

9. | have considered the submissions advanced by the rival parties
and | have perused the pleadings as well as the records produced by the
learned CGC.

10. The petitioner in his writ petition has made a representation
that his ailment of suffering brain hemorrhage was emergency and for
which immediate medical attention was required. The undisputed fact Is
that Unit Hospital was not equipped to attend his ailment. Furthermore,
the Gurunanak Government Hospital at Amritsar also does not have the
facilities for performing neoru surgery. That is why the petitioner was
referred to other hospitals having such facilities. No doubt, the petitioner
was given a choice of PGIMER, Chandigarh and AIIMS Hospital for
undertaking neuro surgery but nevertheless, to strictly abide by the advice
at the relevant time, considering the condition of the petitioner, the choice
of the petitioner and his relatives to go for the surgery at Ajit Hospital
cannot be faulted with. Court is also not unmindful about the situation
that may have prevailed at the relevant moment. Discretion in such
emergency ordinarily is best to be left with the patient and his relatives
present at that time. However, considering the fact that the petitioner is
an employee of BFIF which is governed by its own Rules, a departure
from the Rules would also be not the most appropriate step that can be

taken. However, what transpired at the relevant time was that the

WP (C) No. 5466 of 2017 Page 6 of 7
petitioner was in requirement of immediate neuro surgery and therefore
considering the case of Suman Rakheja_ (supra), | find the same
applicable to the case of the instant writ petitioner. Therefore, | am of the

considered opinion that he is entitled to similar relief.

11. In that view of the matter, the writ petition is disposed of in
line with the case of Suman Rakheja_ (supra). The petitioner shall be
entitled to 100% medical expenses in the rate of AllIMS, New Delhi and
also 75 % of the expenditure in excess thereto. The petitioner has
contended that recovery has been made from his monthly salary from the
month of August, 2009 and the respondent authorities probably have
recovered the entire amount by now. The amount recovered from the writ
petitioner therefore will be refunded to him through his Bank Account
after making necessary adjustment in terms of the observation made
above. Such exercise shall be carried out within a month from the date of

receipt of a certified copy of this order.

12. Writ petition is accordingly disposed of. No cost.

JUDGMENT AND ORDER (Oral)

Heard Mr. S.C. Biswas, the learned counsel for the writ petitioners. Also
heard Mr. D.C. Borah, the learned Central Government Counsel who appears for
the respondent Nos. 1 to 5 in WP(C) No. 6683/2015 and Ms. A. Dass, the
learned Central Government Counsel appearing for respondent Nos. 1 to 4 in
WP(C) No. 6674/2015. Mr. G. Choudhury, the learned counsel appears for the

private respondent in both the cases.

2. The 2 (two) writ petitions are taken up for disposal together since the

issues involved are the same.

3. The facts of the case in brief is that the private respondent got married to
one Shri. Upen Baishya as per Hindu rites on 16.02.2009. Out of their wedlock
one son Master Hritam Baishya was born to them on 14.04.2011. Shri. Upen
Baishya was appointed under the General Reserve Engineer Force (GREF) as
vehicle mechanic in the month of March, 2000 with his service No. as G.S.181404P and was working under the respondent No. 4. Unfortunately, he died in
harness on 06.09.2015 due to renal failure leaving behind his wife and his young
son Master Hritam Baishya. Late Upen Baishya is also survived by his father Shri
Mohidhar and his mother Smti. Subala Baishya besides his sister Miss. Juri
Baishya. His sister is the writ petitioner in WP(C) 6674/2015 and his parents are
the petitioners in WP(C) 6683/2015.

4. That both his sister and his parents have filed the writ petitions claiming
family pension and of their deceased brother/son retirement benefits and his
wife Smti. Shima Baishya although not impleaded earlier got herself impleaded

as respondent No. 5 and 6 respectively in the two writ petitions.

5. According to the petitioners, the private respondent left her husband in
the early part of 2012 while he was having critical kidney problem and requiring
Intensive nursing and caring. Shri. Upen Baishya therefore in the month of
October, 2014 applied for change of his nominee for receiving service benefits to

the exclusion of the private respondent. Shri. Upen Baishya on having severe

Page 4 of 6
WP(C) 6674/2015
WITH
WP(C) 6683/2015
kidney failure, his father donated one of his kidney to him which however did not
help him to recover and consequently he died in harness on 06.09.2015.
According to the petitioners since the private respondent left Shri. Upen Baishya
and her minor son in their custody, the private respondent cannot be entitled to
family pension and other retirement benefits and moreover since the deceased
Government employee and changed the nomination in his service records during

his life time.

6. Appearing for the official resoondents Mr. D.C. Borah, the learned CGC
submits that although the late Government servant during his life time changed
the nomination in favour of his parents, sister and minor son, the name of the
private respondent ts still very much in the service records. In fact, as per Rule
54 (6) of the CCS Pension Rules, 1972, the wife of the deceased Government
employee only is entitled to family pension in order of preference besides a son
and an unmarried daughter until a certain age. Likewise, Mr. G. Choudhury, the
learned counsel for the private respondent submits that given under the Hindu
Succession Act, 1956 more particularly U/s 10, a widow gets the 1* preference
amongst the Class-| heirs. Besides the widow, the surviving son and daughter
and the mother of the intestate shall each get one share. Under such
circumstance, he submits that none of the petitioners have any right to claim
family pension. However except for the mother of the deceased Government
employee who can have one share from the retirement benefits of her son, the
father and sister of the deceased employee have no share and cannot have any

claim.

7. Mr. G. Choudhury in support of his submission that the widow of
Government employee living separately and not divorce is entitled to family
pension relies upon the decision of the Apex Court rendered in the case G, L.
Bhatia -Vs- Union of [ndia and Anr. (1999) 5 SCC 237. He further relies
upon the case of Shipra Sengupta -Vs- Mridul Sengupta and Ors. (2009)
10 SCC 680 to content that under the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 nomination

does not confer any beneficial interest on nominee.

Page 5 of 6
WP(C) 6674/2015
WITH
WP(C) 6683/2015
8. Mr. G. Choudhury, the learned counsel on instructions submits that
considering the old age of the mother of the deceased Government employee,
the private respondent is willing to give one share of the retirement benefits to
her except the family pension which can only be claim by the private respondent
herself. Therefore, he submits that if the mother of the deceased Government
employee is agreeable to take one share of the retirement benefits, the writ

petitions may be disposed of.

9. Mr. S. C. Biswas, the learned counsel representing both the writ
petitioners submits that the mother of the deceased Government employee is

agreeable to accept the one share offered by the private respondent.

10. In that view of the matter WP(C) 6683/2015 is disposed of with a
direction that the retirement benefits of Late. Upen Baishya upon being
apportioned in 3 (three) equal shares, his mother Smti. Subala Baishya will get
one share and the remaining two shares will be given to the private respondent
and her son Master Hritam Baishya. As for the family pension, the same will be
given to the private respondent in terms of Rule 54 (6) of the CCS Pension Rules,
1972. The official respondents are directed to process the family pension and the

retirement benefits as indicated above.

11. As for WP(C) 6674/2015, upon noticing that the sister of the deceased
Government employee cannot have any share in the family pension as per the
CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972 or the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, the learned
counsel Shri. S. C. Biswas, submits that the petitioner would not like to press the

case. Accordingly, WP(C) No 6674/2015 is disposed of as not pressed.

2. The petitioner had approached this Court earlier by filing WP(C) No.
5361/2009 alongwith two others challenging the selection of the respondent
No. 5 as Anganwadi Worker in No. 1 Matia Sankar Dev LP School Anganwadi
Centre under the Naranyanpur ICDS Project in the district of Lakhimpur. The
writ petition was disposed of on 10.06.2011 directing the Director of Social
Welfare Department to examined the matter and thereafter pass an
appropriate order. However, Since the Director of Social Welfare did not
comply with the Courts order, the petitioner and two others filed a Contempt
Case No. 140/2012, which however was closed on 11.04.2013 (Annexure-E),
considering that the Director of Social Welfare Department in the meantime
had concluded his examination upon the issue and passed the order dated
11.02.2013 (Annexure-D). Although by the said order, the respondent No. 5
herein was found to be belonging to another centre area i.e; Jajarigaon
Anganwadi Centre area, the respondent authorities having failed to consider
the case of the petitioner against the post of Anganwadi Worker pursuant to
the finding of the Director, the petitioner has initiated the present writ

petition again.

3. Mr. D. Saikia, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits
that since there is a clear finding of the Director vide his order dated
11.02.2013 and the same having not been challenged by the respondent No.
5, the petitioner should be consider for appointment as Anganwadi Worker

and appointed, Court may pass an appropriate order.

4, Mr. A. Chakraborty, the learned Government Advocate on the other

appended with the writ petition, it appears that the respondent No. 5 was
